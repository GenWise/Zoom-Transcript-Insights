00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.970
Gifted World: My audio isn't working, so I'll just join from my phone.

4
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.040
Sowmya A: Sure I mean I can hear you.

5
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.139

Ranjith P C: Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon. Sunset.

18
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.390
Sreenath C: Good afternoon, sir.

19
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.870
Pushpa A: Oh! Hi! Charlotte!

20
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.000
Pushpa A: Namaste.

21
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.099
Sowmya A: Did you all have a good week so far?

22
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.370
Pushpa A: Yeah, yeah, pull in, zoom. Till then I've come back to school.

23
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.280
Sowmya A: Yeah.

24
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.309
Sowmya A: just give it another couple of minutes and see if people are able to join.

25
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.075
Rama K S: Sir.

26
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.589
Rama K S: Excuse me, sir. I had a.

27
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.560
Sowmya A: Yes, yes.

28
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:23.150
Rama K S: Regarding the feedback form, because after I submitted it twice, once I submitted again. It asked me to, you know. Give the feedback. Then one more mail I received for giving the feedback. I just wanted to know. How will we get to know whether it is submitted or not? Soon, because continuously, I think I got 2 to 3 mains.

29
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.790
Sowmya A: Yeah, that shouldn't be. Actually, I mean, you should have gotten only one mail. What was it? All from the same email? Id.

30
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.759
Rama K S: Yeah, from the same email address.

31
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.280
Rama K S: So second time also, I did. But 3rd time I didn't, because I have to write the same thing. So.

32
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.699
Sowmya A: I don't know if it is done. How will we get to know whether it is submitted or not? I'm not sure.

33
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.130
Sowmya A: Yeah, if it says, response submitted that setting.

34
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.350
Rama K S: After that again I received a mail

35
00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:57.520
Rama K S: submitted. Here again it said, sorry for the wrong link. Something like that.

36
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.370
Sowmya A: Oh!

37
00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.800
Rama K S: I don't know.

38
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.850
Sowmya A: Who did it come from?

39
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.890
Rama K S: To others.

40
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020
Sowmya A: What? What was the email? Id, from which it came?

41
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.850
Rama K S: One second. So the same person.

42
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.759
Rama K S: One second, sir, I'm checking it.

43
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.470
Sowmya A: Yeah.

44
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.380
Rama K S: So Samya Jettison, Sir.

45
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.080
Sowmya A: Okay.

46
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.409
Rama K S: Omnia, jettation only exist.

47
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.979
Sowmya A: Yeah, so me might have sent it. I'll check with her once. I don't think it will happen again.

48
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.430
Sowmya A: Yeah, I know.

49
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.979
Sowmya A: I think going forward. We can use the link

50
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.850
Sowmya A: that link itself can be used. So you don't need to. I I think we, I'll just send an email

51
00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:55.749
Sowmya A: mentioning that you can fill up the feedback form, and you can use the same thing. If there is a new link, then I'll let you know.

52
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.449
Sowmya A: So yeah, I mean as summaries. You don't have to bother it. It once it says submitted. It will exit. You don't have to.

53
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.610
Rama K S: Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir.

54
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:35.079
Sowmya A: I hope all of you had a chance to look at the excel sheet that the shared Google sheet that I had put in the resources folder. So that's just to help you navigate through. You know, we are multiple links that we are always sharing. So it might become a little confusing. So we just put one place where all the links will be, and you can refer to only that for your purpose.

55
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.850
Sowmya A: Yes, and I think some. There was some confusion regarding the document, the blank document

56
00:05:43.868 --> 00:06:04.859
Sowmya A: it is going to be used for the upcoming assignments. So so far, what we've been doing is, we've had Google forms for filling up your responses, going forward. Whatever assignments we have, you can paste it or put your response in the Google document itself for the assignments going forward. So I was just creating documents for each one of you.

57
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.560
Sowmya A: So I think that's why you got a notification.

58
00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:15.060
Sowmya A: So yeah, going forward, you can. You can use that for your assignments responses.

59
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.340
Sowmya A: Sure, kid, I think we're good to start.

60
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:38.730
Sowmya A: Yeah, I think in the interest of time. Respecting the fact that you've all joined on time. So let's get started. So today we are going to discuss integers an interesting topic.

61
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.570
Sowmya A: Let me put it on slideshow.

62
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:47.140
Sowmya A: So

63
00:06:47.450 --> 00:07:00.229
Sowmya A: there are these 3 things which are put on these images. We will be discussing. Why? Why these 3 images are there? In a bit there's a thermometer. There are some buttons.

64
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.089
Sowmya A: and then there's a a ledger accounting ledger.

65
00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:09.260
Sowmya A: Any thoughts, anyone. Why these 3 things are there on this slide.

66
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.039
latha sriram: Obviously, thermometer, we measure the temperature negative and positive.

67
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.760
latha sriram: Similarly, income and expenditure. It is always a debit and credit, positive and negative. It's going to be

68
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.960
latha sriram: same is the thing with the buttons. Probably one color represents positive one. Color represents negative integers.

69
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.220
Sowmya A: Yes, that's true.

70
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:37.749
Sowmya A: However, what I'm going to cover is how it might. One of these

71
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:47.508
Sowmya A: might put a different perspective to how we see integers, we might each might have a different way in which we look at integers so that we

72
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.840
Sowmya A: look at in a bit.

73
00:07:50.420 --> 00:08:00.850
Sowmya A: So let's just start off. Let's start with the basic question that we always have for any topic. Right? What are integers? And why do we even need them

74
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.650
Sowmya A: any thoughts on that, not able to see any other.

75
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.910
Sowmya A: any thoughts on that.

76
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.089
Sowmya A: You can also respond on the chat. If you want.

77
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.419
Pushpa A: Set of both the positive and negative numbers.

78
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.759
Pushpa A: And why do we need them? Is because we come across even negative numbers in our daily life.

79
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:56.080
Pushpa A: So it's just not sufficient to have a set of whole numbers. We need even the negative numbers also. So to learn.

80
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.730
Pushpa A: That is where that is how we bring them, introduce them to teachers.

81
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.620
Sowmya A: Okay.

82
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.580
Sowmya A: Okay.

83
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:24.269
Pushpa A: I mean, children know about teachers much earlier than we start in the class because they would have seen negative teachers in many places in thermometers. And I mean while recording to the temperature or in the lifts all those things. So that is

84
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.889
Pushpa A: why do we need them? They know that we there is something called as a negative number, and we need to learn about it.

85
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.479
Sowmya A: Okay, okay, any other thoughts from anyone?

86
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.740
Sowmya A: That account.

87
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.729
Sowmya A: So do you think? Just for the group? Do you think it's easy? An easy transition. When

88
00:09:50.451 --> 00:09:58.878
Sowmya A: they start, all they've started with is natural numbers, positive numbers, tangible things. How do you explain a negative thing?

89
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.430
Sowmya A: when you say a negative thing, because before you know, before they learn about negative numbers

90
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.489
Sowmya A: for them, positive integers can signify objects, tangible objects.

91
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:18.000
Sowmya A: right? When they say 5 things, 4 things, 5 plus 4, 5 plus 5 plus 5 repeated.

92
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:24.150
Sowmya A: they can always associate it with an object, but when we say negative, although they may understand it.

93
00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:37.149
Sowmya A: Can they understand negative things? Right? They may understand. Negative flows when the lift is going up or down, they may understand negative direction, but can they understand negative things.

94
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.620
Sowmya A: and what is the right time to introduce that concept to them?

95
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:50.319
latha sriram: Actually, they do understand, sir, in the sense. Suppose there are 8 kids, and I say that I have only 5 chocolates.

96
00:10:50.460 --> 00:11:15.440
latha sriram: I don't have 3 they really understand. So where does that role of negative integer comes in when I do not have something. But then I have to give that. So how many more I need. This is what we generally introduce when we introduce also. And we basically for 6, th we introduce like this, walking forward. I just walk forward. How many steps did I walk? Then I come back, but but I'll not come back to the original point where I started.

97
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:26.290
latha sriram: so I'll make them understand what happens sometimes. What I what I'll do is I'll walk towards the right, less number of steps, but then towards the left. When I'm moving back, I'll walk more steps.

98
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.859
latha sriram: so they will say, You move 2 steps extra, ma'am, towards the left.

99
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.759
latha sriram: So when they say that yes, here is where this negative integer comes into play.

100
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.780
latha sriram: We can explain in 600 like this, I don't know about junior classes whether it's possible to interest, introduce negative numbers in those classes.

101
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.330
Sowmya A: Yeah.

102
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.960
Sowmya A: So just 1 point. If you notice that.

103
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.070
Sowmya A: that's why I had that 3 images on the

104
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:24.410
Sowmya A: on the 1st slide. Basically, if we look at tangible things as soon as we go into negative numbers, we, the examples that we give tend to be more about direction. So we move from an accounting concept of integers where we are saying, add and subtract things, but as soon as we add things more mainly, and then you can take away something only when you have enough to give.

105
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.070
Sowmya A: so if I have 5 objects, I can give away 3.

106
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.850
Sowmya A: But if I have 3 objects, can I give away 5.

107
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:56.899
Sowmya A: That concept is not so readily acceptable compared to when I convert that into a scenario of moving in a direction? Because as soon as I say, direction, this example of steps that you gave it becomes easier to explain negative numbers. So are we also changing context when we move from positive number examples to negative number examples. And if we are doing that.

108
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.770
Sowmya A: then is this causing some kind of a confusion in the minds of children? Because.

109
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.420
latha sriram: Can you afford it?

110
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.910
Sowmya A: Samples, also changes.

111
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.240
latha sriram: When you say negative numbers, children come up with so many examples without even you opening your mouth.

112
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:26.920
latha sriram: Have you ever seen anything negative like numbers. Have you heard of you? Just say that they will start telling you all these negative flows? Then they will tell. Main is blood test, ma'am. We don't want it to be positive we would love it to be negative. This 600 children are given this

113
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:48.149
latha sriram: especially during covid time, and all of it is covid negative. We are very happy, ma'am, so it's not that children are totally ignorant. They do understand. We start with steps. Basically, that chocolate is also an example. We start with steps. Sometimes we even draw it in the class. If there is enough space, you know the corridor outside, and we do things make them come and stand like that and all.

114
00:13:48.300 --> 00:14:00.340
latha sriram: So they do understand basic things only when negative integer that operation comes, they find it difficult, definitely subtracting negative integers, and at that point of time there is a lot of confusion.

115
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:17.990
Sowmya A: I'll take a small example for this case. Supposing I'd say 5, minus 3. So it's a very easy example to explain, saying I had 5 things, and I took away 3. How many were left? Right? 5 minus 2. Very easy to explain, with tangible things.

116
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.590
Sowmya A: But if I reorient that and I say, what is minus? 3 plus 5.

117
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.739
Sowmya A: Now, how will you explain that to a student? Or how will a student explain that? Now.

118
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:38.610
Sreenath C: Sir, normally, what? How we will start integers is using materials that is tokens.

119
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.970
Sreenath C: Can you hear me, sir?

120
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.879
Sowmya A: Yes, yes, yes, please go.

121
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:51.389
Sreenath C: So in a token you know, that's a plastic token. It's like a ₹1 coin where one side we will write P. On the side we will write. N.

122
00:14:51.590 --> 00:15:01.349
Sreenath C: So we will not say that 2 children that P. Stands for positive, and N stands for negative. We will not say that, but we will say that P. Stands for profit

123
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.540
Sreenath C: and N stands for loss.

124
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:17.880
Sreenath C: So this is what we say, and we will start with a game called game of opposites. So their role is that they have to pick one handful of tokens from their packet. They have to spread it

125
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.929
Sreenath C: so they are not supposed to change the orientation in whichever way they are getting, they ought to spread it.

126
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:29.900
Sreenath C: They can pair p and n's, so the when they pair pay p and n's, the value becomes 0. This is the standard rule.

127
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:37.780
Sreenath C: So they start removing pairs of P and n, and at the end, what is their collection? So if they have 5 piece.

128
00:15:38.110 --> 00:16:07.409
Sreenath C: that means they have 5 points 5. It's like a point. They are getting 5 points, and if they have 5 ends, that means they are losing 5 points. So this help them to understand that the difference between positive and negative. So we will play this game for you know, quite around 1, 1, 2, 3, or 4 classes. After that we slowly introduce to the concept of integers. So this game itself, you know, leads to addition as well as subtraction of integers. Also.

129
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:24.120
Sowmya A: So that makes really good sense. And I agree that it must be very effective as well to solve it, just just for the purpose of discussion and curiosity. Do you think somebody who's learning integers by this method

130
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.390
Sowmya A: where negative is also a thing right

131
00:16:28.992 --> 00:16:36.447
Sowmya A: where you're saying, because it's the other flip side of the coin. So that means negative is also tangible. Right?

132
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.050
Sowmya A: that.

133
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:46.049
Sowmya A: How will they reconcile this with the concept of a deficit, saying, when you have money and you don't have money.

134
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.570
Sowmya A: there is. You don't have negative money right?

135
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:55.569
Sowmya A: But you have a deficit, so you don't have anything.

136
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:03.589
Sowmya A: So how do you, at some point of time, how will you help children? Or how will this approach help children to make that jump

137
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:11.450
Sowmya A: from knowing that negative may not be a thing. It's the lack of something conceptually

138
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:18.779
Sowmya A: does, does that is, does that even pose a problem? Or do you think the approach that you're taking. Actually.

139
00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:24.649
Sowmya A: the children pick it up on their own, based on this method that you're mentioning.

140
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.719
Sowmya A: What do you think you feel that

141
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:41.870
Sowmya A: this could be a challenge at some point, for some students understanding the concept of a deficit versus learning it as a negative object, which is

142
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:59.720
Sowmya A: probably more like in tune with physics or the concept of matter, antimatter that kind of thing. So. But if they are looking at, that's why I mentioned these 3 different approaches. In accounting, you know that you can have a deficit. That means the lack of something

143
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.350
Sowmya A: is understood. Well, but it is not negative thing. It's not a negative object.

144
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:36.029
Sreenath C: Definitely, sir. See, it's not that all the children will be able to know. Understand it very clearly. But some of them will connect it with real life things. And they they get the clear meaning of negative, as you told. But the children who has problem right? Something like a below achiever and all. It is very difficult for them to understand the concept of negative numbers.

145
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.509
Sowmya A: So so far, what you've been using is this concept of the coins

146
00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:50.339
Sowmya A: primary, positive and negative. And to explain numbers? Okay, great, that makes sense any other thoughts, any other approaches by anyone.

147
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.519
Radha Sharma: Good afternoon, everyone.

148
00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:16.979
Radha Sharma: Sir, in I class, when we are introducing integer, the best way is using the directions, and when we are talking about means even number line also helps a lot, because after 0 there should be something when we are even taking temperature. So below 0, we are taking the temperatures.

149
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:25.380
Radha Sharma: So means taking these examples. So always, we are starting with a lift only because nowadays learners are going to Mall and all.

150
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.870
Radha Sharma: So there they are, taking that minus 2 minus one parking floors.

151
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.580
Radha Sharma: So again, 1st means make them understand that 0 is the base.

152
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:54.690
Radha Sharma: So 0 is just a middle value. So if we are coming up, then we are taking it as above sea level. That is positive values. But if we are going down, then we are taking it as negative value. So it is just a direction, even when we are adding and subtracting, using a number line.

153
00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:07.790
Radha Sharma: so that time also it may, it becomes easier because in on number line learners are getting confused because they don't know, don't know the exact rule that whether we have to go right hand, side or left, hand side

154
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.770
Radha Sharma: addition, and subtracting and subtraction of the entities.

155
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:25.210
Radha Sharma: So it's better to use means the number line, and then telling them that if it is a negative, if we are negative, then we are going in the opposite direction.

156
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.720
Sowmya A: Okay.

157
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:49.740
Sowmya A: So then, how do you explain to a child who may be working on a word problem which has things like a certain child had say, the chocolate example, 5 chocolates, and he had to give it away to the other children. So then, how would understanding it from an elevator perspective.

158
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:57.260
Sowmya A: How or a number line? How would that child be able to explain it in terms of tangible things, like chocolates or money?

159
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:17.839
Radha Sharma: Means. If he is having 5 chocolates, and he has to give 8 chocolates out of that. So he is only having 5. So the 5 he can already give but 3 he also need, because he don't have that.

160
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:29.379
Radha Sharma: So 3 more chocolates he also needs, so it will be a scarcity of 3 chocolates, so we can take it as minus 3.

161
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.779
Sowmya A: And then how would you explain? Say, minus 3 plus minus 3 in terms of chocolates, then?

162
00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.599
Sowmya A: Sir, can you repeat your question?

163
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:53.820
Sowmya A: Yeah. Yeah. So you said minus 3. But now, if you had to explain to him what would be minus 3 chocolates plus minus 3 chocolates, what does that mean?

164
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.200
Radha Sharma: Okay, so minus 3, it is means we have to.

165
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:16.090
Radha Sharma: I think inteser is telling means letting them thinking. It is not just a number and addition subtraction, we are telling them so, minus 3 minus represents that it is a lack of chocolate.

166
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:25.030
Radha Sharma: So if minus 3, and then plus means again something. Also we are taking. So minus 3, the lack of 3 chocolates, and again minus 3.

167
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:38.530
Radha Sharma: So again, more lack of more. 3 chocolate is there, so it will be minus 6 chocolates now, so it will be. Now the lack of chocolate is increasing by 3 more is minus 6. Now.

168
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:48.060
Sowmya A: Okay. So basically, you are. What I'm understanding is you are, you are able to explain lack of something as negative. It doesn't have to be

169
00:22:48.170 --> 00:23:00.529
Sowmya A: something like a tangible like in an elevator. There is a ground floor, and there is a floor below that. But in case of chocolates it's you don't have it, but you can still explain it, using a negative number.

170
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:21.279
Radha Sharma: Yes, sir, because we have to explain minus sign. We are not talking about the numbers we are talking about minus sign. So if minus is written. It means they don't have that. They also need. That means, if we have to explain it, we can even call 2 or 3 students, so it will become easier for us means.

171
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:32.239
Radha Sharma: for example, if I will give 3, I'm taking 3 students from the class and then giving 5 chocolates to a student, and then telling that you have to give 8 chocolates

172
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:49.879
Radha Sharma: to the other one. But then he will say that, ma'am, I have only 5. How I, how can I give 3 8 chocolates? Then, okay, so how many more chocolates you need? So that is a 3 chocolates. He need more. So that is minus 3. It means you have a lack of 3 chocolates with you.

173
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.069
Radha Sharma: It's so like this. We can explain it.

174
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:09.859
MANISHA LIGADE: So we can explain that whatever chocolates you have or you're going to receive it, it will be, indicate positive integers and chocolates which you are losing or you're going, it will be negative integers.

175
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:17.450
MANISHA LIGADE: So if you, if you can tell them, then they may understand the concept, positive or negative integers.

176
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.049
Radha Sharma: Is one more way, sir, what we have means means just

177
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:30.120
Radha Sharma: thinking about that. Only that how to introduce in teaser in lower grades, for example, grade 6 only we are introducing in teaser.

178
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:57.090
Radha Sharma: So how? So? What we have taken? We have even made the tiles of in teasers means like color change. So negative change. Negative color means, for example, green color of tile or green color of paper. I have taken for negative in teasers and red color paper. I have taken positive. So as we are discussing this chocolate example, even, we can use that also to introduce means, discuss this or introduce in teasers.

179
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.289
Sowmya A: Makes sense anyone else any other thoughts.

180
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.800
Sowmya A: Okay.

181
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:34.219
Sowmya A: so we'll be looking at each of these approaches at some point I'm not sure if you had any of you had a chance to look at some of the documents that I put in the resources folder. One is a very nice article on how to teach integers with a similar scenario, with buttons red buttons and green buttons. I think that is similar to what you were mentioning. Where we have

182
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:42.639
Sowmya A: tangible things, and one is positive, the other is negative, and the underlying logic is positive and negative makes 0.

183
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.499
Sowmya A: So thereby you can bring in 0 amount of things without changing the value.

184
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:58.820
Sowmya A: and that the reason for that is so that you can take away positive things or take away negative things to suit your value. Again, I feel that's more of an algorithmic approach which

185
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:09.700
Sowmya A: absolutely makes it very easy to solve questions. But how much they can relate this to real life problems. I think we we may need to explore further.

186
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:16.939
Sowmya A: So that, let's just look at a few questions and then see how we can go about them.

187
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.970
Sowmya A: Let's see.

188
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.620
Chitra Mohan: Hello, sir!

189
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.100
Chitra Mohan: Am I audible?

190
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.859
Sowmya A: Yes, yes, chitra.

191
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.040
Sowmya A: Yes.

192
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:42.220
Chitra Mohan: I explain with 2 different examples. As she is saying, I don't know how far I'm successful. One is, I'll take a reference with reference to it. It is lower value and higher value

193
00:26:43.270 --> 00:27:06.409
Chitra Mohan: for everything there has to be a reference. For example, if it is lift ground floor is the reference above ground, level above ground, floor, and below ground. 4. So if it is sea level, even if it is calories of weight, reduction from your current weight. Calories added calories down the same way. Take an example of a dam where red mark is given. If the water exceeds above the red, it is

194
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:33.030
Chitra Mohan: excess water, evacuated places. When it is below it is dropped. Something like that I bring in, so that they understand that negative integer, because once you say negative. I've seen children writing minus ₹5 minus. Where money cannot be negative distance cannot be negative. I don't have minus 10 kilometers. It is only the direction in whichever direction I'm opposite. So I give an example of these things like

195
00:27:33.446 --> 00:27:53.299
Chitra Mohan: whichever reference it differs from place to place. If it is a ground floor like this, or if it is a number line concept comes later, then I teach them that. Let us assume that you have good qualities or positive qualities. You wake up on time, go to school on time, do your homework and other things like

196
00:27:53.853 --> 00:27:58.299
Chitra Mohan: you're waking up at 7, 45, and you should come to school, it is treated as a negative.

197
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:14.239
Chitra Mohan: If you want to add the more negative. Instead of waking up early, you have wake. You're late again by 9 o'clock. It is adding more negative. When you correct your one of your negative quality, you become more positive, so your positive value increases.

198
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.540
Sowmya A: Yeah, that's really nice. I think.

199
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:23.599
Chitra Mohan: Like I I and that times I see children after integers. I've seen few of them packing

200
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:49.969
Chitra Mohan: their water bottles. I just list instead of helping your mother filling your own water bottle. Doing your homework and packing books is a positive quality coming to school on as a positive quality for that. You need to wake up little early. My school is at 8 o'clock. I'll wake up at 7, 45. I'll not brush. I'm in a hurry. I'll not comb. I'll not keep my books. That's considered as a negative with reference to a particular, your school

201
00:28:49.970 --> 00:29:19.780
Chitra Mohan: system in a school or a disciplinary school. So the more you are doing all such things, it is added, and you become more negative, more negative qualities. So that's how I introduce. But I was not successful in subtraction, but addition, I'm successful, and I see children correcting. Next day they'll come, ma'am. I filled my water bottle. So do you think I increase my positive quality by 1 point or one number. I say, yes, so do your work. This is how I.

202
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.220
Sowmya A: Reducing.

203
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.619
Chitra Mohan: And I tell them.

204
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.119
Sowmya A: That's really nice, actually.

205
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:49.599
Chitra Mohan: Mostly calories, burned, calories consumed. If somebody, one child is bullied instead of telling that, I'd say not say overweight. So from today today, your weight or your body is referenced. From tomorrow you're not going for junk food, and you're reducing so reducing the calories. Lot of examples I have, I'll say specifically, don't write minus 10 kilometers

206
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:58.009
Chitra Mohan: instead of right. 10 kilometers south, 10 kilometers worth. I cannot have even the reverse direction. I cannot go more

207
00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.469
Chitra Mohan: so. All these.

208
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.860
Sowmya A: Yeah.

209
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:27.220
Chitra Mohan: For example, which are in the real life. I'll be quoting a lot of such example, especially they enjoy with the dam. We have excess water. In Chennai for 2015, 1,600, we had a lot of rainwater where the people of houses have been drenched with water, so whenever I give example, they connect to it also. Okay, ma'am, once it's exceed the upper limit, it indicates lot of water in the dam, and the gates are lifted.

210
00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:34.180
Chitra Mohan: The villages are so more when it is below it indicates drought, scarcity of water.

211
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:58.599
Chitra Mohan: so it is a reference to the level. What exactly existing now depth of well in the water in the well. Not only this, I have a lot of example from 1 point moving to the other in your piggy bank you have. You are dropping coin every day is positive integer. You are taking away coin because they do. They open the piggy bank and take the coins.

212
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.500
Sowmya A: Yeah.

213
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.119
Chitra Mohan: So your money reduced by a small quantity.

214
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.360
Sowmya A: Yeah, that's good.

215
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.729
Sowmya A: These are the most of the most of the.

216
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.420
Chitra Mohan: I don't have.

217
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:10.819
Sowmya A: Think you've.

218
00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:19.810
Chitra Mohan: But this water bottle filling alone I have experienced. The next day they'll come and say, ma'am, I filled my water bottle. I didn't depend on my mother.

219
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:20.784
Sowmya A: Yeah.

220
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:36.067
Sowmya A: yeah, I think those are good examples, because you've covered deficit as well as directions understanding the lack of something as negative as well as using negative as a direction. It's not a lack of something, it's more of a direction. And that's what I was trying to.

221
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.040
Chitra Mohan: Yes.

222
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.960
Sowmya A: Indicate. So what you'll do.

223
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.310
Chitra Mohan: Oh!

224
00:31:39.635 --> 00:31:39.960
Sowmya A: We.

225
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.470
Chitra Mohan: Thanks.

226
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.880
Sowmya A: Very good.

227
00:31:40.880 --> 00:32:01.779
Chitra Mohan: And I insist on the reference point changes from one place to other place. If it's integer number, I have 0. If it's a building. It is ground floor. If it is submarine or plane, it is sea level. So with reference, I have a reference above that reference and below the reference. I get that concept.

228
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:14.229
Sowmya A: Yeah, that actually is very, very nice. The fact that you are always mentioning a reference point. I think it's a very good place to start for, you know, in terms of math.

229
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:23.580
Sowmya A: to always mention a reference point. I think if they understand reference frames and reference points earlier, it's it's going to help them a lot later.

230
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.700
Sowmya A: So that's a good thing. So what I'll do now is, I'll

231
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:48.630
Sowmya A: put a question on the this thing on the screen. And then hopefully, we should have some breakout rooms where we can move into. And then discuss basically, this particular question, what would you think is the best approach for this? What do you think, students, how would students approach this problem.

232
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.140
latha sriram: Excuse me. Do you mind going to slideshow?

233
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.030
Sona M: Slides.

234
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:59.380
Sowmya A: Yeah, I will. I will. But I just want to set up generally, will. Is Siddharth going to set up the

235
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.890
Sowmya A: breakout rooms.

236
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.630
Janani Eswar: I spoke in. I've set it up.

237
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:10.209
Sowmya A: You set it up so I can ask them to move to each of the rooms. I'll just put the names.

238
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.420
Sowmya A: No, I've chat.

239
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:20.540
Janani Eswar: I can just open it, and you'll they'll all get. Everyone will get a notification to go to their correct room. Just let me know when you would like to open it.

240
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:33.270
Sowmya A: Yeah, I think we can start now, we can start now. So basically, for for all of you participants, we'll put about 5 of you in a breakout room, a group of 5, and

241
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.090
Sowmya A: I'll share a

242
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:59.220
Sowmya A: folder location where there is a document for each breakout room and or what you need to do is as a group discuss on what might be the best approach to solving this particular question, and where students might have a challenge in solving this question. So as a small group, you can discuss this and make your notes in that Google document.

243
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:09.099
Sowmya A: And then, after, say, about 5, 10 min, we can come back and then discuss as a group what our findings are. Okay? So I just

244
00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:15.959
Sowmya A: mention what the documents are for each, the link for each document. I'll put it in the chat.

245
00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.849
Janani Eswar: Once you've shared that I'll open up the room shaky.

246
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:30.170
Sowmya A: Yeah, thank you. Let me just go to the chat down.

247
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.319
Sowmya A: So this is the folder here. You will see documents

248
00:34:56.398 --> 00:35:08.650
Sowmya A: break with the title, Breakout room, one breakout room, 2. Breakout room 3 like that. So whichever is your and your name will be mentioned in the document. So if I open up just one, maybe that might be easier for you to understand.

249
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.710
Janani Eswar: Great. So I'm opening the room. Shakur.

250
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.090
Sowmya A: Sorry.

251
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.920
Janani Eswar: Should I go ahead and open the rooms?

252
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:22.640
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, okay. So each room has the name of the participants. So with, what are the questions you may want to answer?

253
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.930
Sowmya A: And the question is on the screen. I'll put it on slideshow.

254
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.730
Sowmya A: no

255
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.310
Sowmya A: at any point, if you have doubts, you can reach to reach out to me.

256
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.830
Janani Eswar: Wait. I think everyone's in their breakout rooms. Okay.

257
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.190
Sowmya A: Yeah, it looks like that. And.

258
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.279
Janani Eswar: So I'll go ahead and drop off for the moment. Then.

259
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.449
Sowmya A: Yeah, thank, you.

260
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:37.620
Janani Eswar: Super you're you are familiar with how to manage them. If if you want to change anything in the breakout room.

261
00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:45.819
Sowmya A: Not much. But supposing if I if I want them to come back and then go back to a breakout room, then what do I do?

262
00:36:47.565 --> 00:36:54.440
Janani Eswar: So there's this option in the bottom of your screen. There'll be this option called breakout rooms, usually next to the polls, and quizzes option.

263
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.670

266
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:12.660

267
00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:19.100
Janani Eswar: and if you would like to chat with all of them or send them a message, it's also available in the chat.

269
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:33.600
Sowmya A: Okay? And supposing when they come back and how do they go back to their breakout rooms again? So they just choose it from the dropdown right.

Janani Eswar: To how you see breakout rooms. They will see.

271

366
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.590
MANISHA LIGADE: No, I have. I have joined. I am there in room number 2. I have joined it.

367
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.700
Janani Eswar: No, ma'am, you are right now in the main room. Just have to click that button once more.

368
00:45:51.400 --> 00:46:02.460
MANISHA LIGADE: Okay, see breakout room. I have clicked it. Then I went to. There are break route, breakout room 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rooms. I can see if I go to second one. I my name is there.

369
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.520
Janani Eswar: Your name is there. Click! Join, ma'am.

370
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.399
MANISHA LIGADE: Yes, yeah, I have joined already, and then I can see one question over there.

371
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.130
Janani Eswar: Question.

372
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.819
Janani Eswar: I just see one question. That's it.

373
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:24.400
Janani Eswar: The Google Doc. So that is also, that's the Google Doc. You need to do. Can you open zoom again?

374
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.299
MANISHA LIGADE: Okay, should I go to the main meeting first? st

375
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.299
Janani Eswar: Yeah, go to the Zoom Meeting.

376
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:41.279
Janani Eswar: where you can see Jananeesh, your gifted world and yourself.

377
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.229
Janani Eswar: You can see that.

378
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.350
MANISHA LIGADE: No, I'm not getting it exactly what is what to do.

379
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.069
Janani Eswar: Can you open zoom?

380
00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:01.789
MANISHA LIGADE: I'm there. See? Now I'm there, the main main meeting. Okay. Now I going to chat.

381
00:47:02.107 --> 00:47:13.850
Janani Eswar: Not in the chat, not in the chat. Hold on 1 min, so near the chat, icon, you'll see, react, raise hand, all of that. Do you see? One more option with 3 dots in a circle.

382
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.040
MANISHA LIGADE: Okay.

383
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.330
MANISHA LIGADE: Yeah. Hmm.

384
00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.729
Janani Eswar: Do you see an option called Join breakout room.

385
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:21.530
MANISHA LIGADE: Yes.

386
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.939
Janani Eswar: Just click that. Please.

387
00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.140
latha sriram: Hi! Letta, ma'am, Sona, ma'am, we are back. After the discussion.

388
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.390
Janani Eswar: Okay, finished. It.

389
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.200
latha sriram: Yeah, all of us.

390
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.579
Janani Eswar: Okay, great. I was worried. There was more technical problems. Okay.

391
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.840
Sona M: Superb.

392
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:56.989
Janani Eswar: The I'll just check in with Sharkin. I think he's having some Internet issue. He just dropped off for a second. Give me a minute. I'll just call him and check in.

393
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.740
latha sriram: Thank you.

394
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:52.859
Sowmya A: I hope all of you have found your breakout rooms. If there's any question or

395
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.739
Sowmya A: doubt, just let me know.

396
00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:01.260
Janani Eswar: Hi, so we've had one group finish what they needed to, and they've come back in as well.

397
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.990
Sowmya A: Okay.

398
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:25.569
Janani Eswar: Shakin. Would you like me to bring people back? Give them a 1 min warning.

399
00:51:27.746 --> 00:51:28.560
Janani Eswar: You're muted.

400
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.269
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, that. That's right. Yeah.

401
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:32.190
Janani Eswar: Okay.

402
00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:38.840
Sowmya A: Yeah.

403
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:15.040
Suneyna CP: Per odd number. In that way we can teach right the powers

404
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.850
Suneyna CP: so minus one to the power of 3.

405
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.819
Suneyna CP: So in that case they'll minus one into minus one into minus one.

406
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:27.070
Suneyna CP: In that case it is fine. It is again negative integer. They'll get.

407
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:34.580
Chitra Mohan: No, ma'am, the ordering concept. If it is same number no, then we will not be asking

408
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.050
Chitra Mohan: about this using the Delta where the value is not known.

409
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:47.919
Chitra Mohan: My ordering capacity, or if I've understood that higher the number lesser the in the negative side, it is better minus.

410
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:52.050
Chitra Mohan: If they are thorough. With that automatically they will understand that products

411
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:56.620
Chitra Mohan: multiply a negative number by a positive number. It gives me a negative number.

412
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.330
Suneyna CP: Negative, number.

413
00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:58.750
Chitra Mohan: Absolute value.

414
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:59.390
Suneyna CP: Correct.

415
00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:08.659
Chitra Mohan: In such cases chances of going to the positive answer. The other misconception would be delta plus 2.

416
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.050
Suneyna CP: Minus 9 plus 2.

417
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:20.360
Chitra Mohan: There is one option, 2 minus delta. There is another option with Delta divided by 2 and plus 2.

418
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.589
Chitra Mohan: If I place my negative number in the beginning.

419
00:54:25.115 --> 00:54:25.469
Suneyna CP: Bye.

420
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:29.910
Chitra Mohan: I am adding, and I may get a greater value. That misconception I've seen with the children.

421
00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.130
Suneyna CP: Okay.

422
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.789
Chitra Mohan: Minus 3 plus 2, they end up writing plus 2, 5.

423
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.400
Chitra Mohan: So they think that better value.

424
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.210
Suneyna CP: Correct.

425
00:54:39.467 --> 00:54:43.239
Chitra Mohan: But rarely, it could be a 15% like that

426
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:59.490
Chitra Mohan: for few of them, only it is when the negative integer in the second part as a minute end or add end or somewhere, they are okay. But otherwise, if the negative integer comes first, st I've seen children seeing the plus 2, they'll add it.

427
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.450
Suneyna CP: Correct, correct.

428
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.340
Chitra Mohan: Out of 32 or 3 will do this.

429
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.109
Chitra Mohan: thinking that it becomes positive, and it will increase the value.

430
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.040
Janani Eswar: You're be able to.

431
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:17.459
Janani Eswar: Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to let you let shock. You know that everyone's back shopping.

432
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.850
Sowmya A: Thank you.

433
00:55:19.156 --> 00:55:25.279
Suchita Kadambi: Sir, I think, Ranjit, sir, I think our discussion is already there in the chat. It's chat to everyone.

434
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:29.649
Suchita Kadambi: so I don't think I need to put it in a word, file.

435
00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:32.359
Ranjith P C: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's fine. I for our.

436
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:32.999
Chitra Mohan: Can you go back.

437
00:55:33.373 --> 00:55:36.360
Ranjith P C: Few future reference. You can keep it, ma'am.

438
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.360
Suchita Kadambi: Okay, sir. Okay, sir.

439
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.110
Suneyna CP: Can we go back.

440
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:43.270
Sowmya A: Yeah.

441
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:49.819
Sowmya A: So I think I hope all of you had a good discussion on this. Any

442
00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:00.659
Sowmya A: thoughts or thoughts from the discussion that you had amongst yourselves that you found important or significant, that others might also benefit from it.

443
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.560
Sowmya A: and anybody would like to share.

444
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:06.740
Madhura shetty: This is.

445
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.266
Suchita Kadambi: I think you can discuss our group, whatever we discussed you can.

446
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.889
Sowmya A: Yeah, if one person from each group.

447
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:18.930
Ranjith P C: Yeah, I sujita, ma'am. You continue, ma'am. I mean, I think you have collected all the points I'll add on.

448
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:40.740
Suchita Kadambi: So the 1st point that we discussed was we had to identify the number. The value of Delta generally. Children take it like a, you know, measuring scale 0 is always a starting point, like the delta value. They will think, that is, you know, the starting point. They will not see. It is to the left of 0 or to the right of 0. So 1st is identification of the value of delta.

449
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:59.859
Suchita Kadambi: That is the 1st thing, then, second thing, that for the 1st question is, they generally see the operation. They think that division or subtraction always when you perform it, the value is always smaller, you get a smaller answer. So that is the second thing for the 1st question.

450
00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:22.940
Suchita Kadambi: then how do they, as generally what children do is through the trial and error method, they assume a value, and on that value they perform the operations and check out. And finally, as Chitra, ma'am said, they should know how to move the value on the number line. Like, if you go to the left, the value decreases. If you move to the right, the value increases that number line concept has to be clear to them.

451
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:31.019
Sowmya A: So my question to you is, when a student is going through, say, for the 1st option, which says, 2 minus delta.

452
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:36.199
Sowmya A: how does he understand what that value will come out to be.

453
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:42.330
Suchita Kadambi: The child must know operations or integers first.st That is also, that is what we have discussed.

454
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:52.450
Sowmya A: Yeah. So since Delta doesn't have a value, all we know is delta is to the left of 0. How does the student reason of what the value of it.

455
00:57:52.450 --> 00:58:12.809
Suchita Kadambi: He picks up through trial and error Delta to the left of 0. He picks up a number randomly, say, to the left of 0. You have minus one or minus 2. I take minus one minus one minus 2 gives me minus 3, minus one into 2 gives me minus 2. So he just picks up a random. That is the most common method, trial, and error method.

456
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:37.439
Ranjith P C: So what she is trying to tell you, sir. I mean, it's if the child pick up the value, delta random trial under another say, Delta is equal to minus 4. So 2 minus delta will become 2 plus 4. Finally, and you get the answer, 6. Okay, so that is one way the child approached. I mean, what we are trying to say is, the initial thought itself will go into the child. That. Okay, let me take that

457
00:58:37.440 --> 00:59:00.780
Ranjith P C: delta value some value and substitute and get. So that's 1 approach itself, you know. And when you give them a scaffolding, and you know, as the shell progress through the cell may tend to use the number line and see that thing where the number is coming, and the question itself the value less. That point has to be emphasized by the teacher when teaching.

458
00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:30.139
Ranjith P C: So now there are 2 instances. In instances we discussed. The child will 1st think that you know, the subtraction will reduce the value and division also. That is their pre knowledge. The knowledge they have with, you know, from the you know, primary classes. So that way they start thinking. Now this this option, if you pick it up, they tend to move in the direction of trial and error, and get some answer and conclude it. That is what.

459
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.489
Ranjith P C: So you're saying, the most common method would be trial and error for students.

460
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:40.239
Ranjith P C: This this the the in 2 minus delta. I'm trying to say that particular option. Yeah, yeah.

461
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.230
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, okay, any other use.

462
00:59:43.230 --> 01:00:05.719
Chitra Mohan: So 2 minus delta. The misconception could be. When I subtract a negative integer from a positive integer, the value will be higher for them. Positive is we taught with the reference I myself I told so. When it is above 0 it will have a greater value when it is below 0. It is a lesser value, so greater, minus lesser value will be greater.

463
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.839
Sowmya A: How if you basically, it's saying greater minus.

464
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:12.750
Chitra Mohan: Smaller.

465
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:13.950
Sowmya A: Value. Yeah, so.

466
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:30.429
Chitra Mohan: I don't go for minus of minus, but I think that from a value which is above 0, I'm subtracting a value which is below 0. So I'll be getting a little higher value. They will not tend to think in other direction. This could be a lesser percentage.

467
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:42.350
Chitra Mohan: I was speaking about one of the options in one particular option out of a class of 33 to 4 I've seen doing delta plus 2, that when the negative integer is given in the first.st

468
01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:55.799
Chitra Mohan: If they're not clear about the concept of absolute value, then they end up giving a different answer. It's a misconception 2 minus 3. They think that minus 3 plus 2 is different.

469
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:58.540
Sowmya A: Hmm! That's what I wanted to ask.

470
01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:10.640
Chitra Mohan: 2 minus of minus 3 and minus 3 plus 2. They assume it to be this, they don't see difference, so they think that it is only addition, and they end up giving some answer, the Ca, option and C option.

471
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.939
Chitra Mohan: Actually, I think they mean the same.

472
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.682
Sowmya A: Okay, okay, so,

473
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:22.590
Chitra Mohan: When absolute value is not into them. Very properly they end up doing such a misconception.

474
01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:30.460
Sowmya A: Okay, thank you. So anyone from room number 2 would like to discuss their findings.

475
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:32.610
Sowmya A: Krishna Kritika.

476
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.480
krithika S: Yes, sir.

477
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:33.860
Sowmya A: Yeah.

478
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:39.959
krithika S: So for how would students usually attempt this question? So we thought, they will fix a value for the Delta.

479
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:47.789
krithika S: and they will use all the options, they will try one by one, the same delta value it will be for everything. So one by one they will check the option.

480
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:51.320
krithika S: So this most of them will go for this method.

481
01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:56.659
krithika S: some of them they will directly go for this division and subtraction.

482
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.520
krithika S: They will choose either division or subtraction.

483
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.590
Sowmya A: Hmm, okay.

484
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:10.820
krithika S: So what are the common mistakes or conceptual gaps? They will get confused with this positive and negative integers.

485
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:23.369
krithika S: So compare, once they get the value they will confuse with this even the comparison. If they get minus 3 and minus 5 as one value, they will get confused, which is lesser than this, that confusion will happen.

486
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:25.939
krithika S: in that they will choose a wrong answer.

487
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.610
Sowmya A: Hmm!

488
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.969
Sowmya A: So what you're saying is, most students will attempt this by taking actual values

489
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.249
krithika S: Yeah, they will.

490
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.670
Sowmya A: Fixer.

491
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.260
krithika S: Value for this. Yes.

492
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:55.690
krithika S: because I think so. This kind of question mostly, as all the operations are there, I think it will come for 7th only in 6 standard. We will not do this question so as it comes to 7, standard side by side, they are doing the linear equations also. So once they see a symbol or a value, immediately their mind will go for substituting a value.

493
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:57.100
Sowmya A: Good.

494
01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.310
Sowmya A: Hmm, so how about option? C. How do students

495
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.310
Sowmya A: evaluate option? C. Is delta divided by 2?

496
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:08.790
Sowmya A: How would we be thinking about.

497
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:28.169
krithika S: If they choose the value as minus one, so minus one divided by 2, most of them should know it lies between 0 and minus one. So when they choose a check for the other options, they have to check it properly, but some of them immediately by us, seeing the division symbol. It is a lower value. They will

498
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.359
krithika S: select that option.

499
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.940
Sowmya A: Hmm, okay, thank you.

500
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.660
Sowmya A: Yeah.

501
01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.830
Sowmya A: Thank you for that. Room number 3.

502
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:40.989
Sowmya A: Rt, Lata Mohamm.

503
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:42.569
Sowmya A: So now she not.

504
01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:52.150
Aarthy B: Yeah, sir, I think, also spoke what we also felt was A and 3, where A and C, where you had a subtraction under division.

505
01:03:52.260 --> 01:04:12.289
Aarthy B: The idea of the value becoming smaller is one misconception we could find, and again, with trial and error also the order in which the options are given, so the moment they encounter the 1st correct ones, which which will satisfy they might stop there, or might not try to explore

506
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:23.380
Aarthy B: if they take minus one or minus 2, it might not give a definite, definite answer, so they might not again, trial and error. There are 2 issues. One is choosing the value.

507
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:28.690
Aarthy B: and second, if one satisfies on the 1st one that satisfies, they will stop.

508
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:39.860
Aarthy B: they don't explore all the further options. So the thought of trying with another number. Why is it satisfying? Why, 2 things are satisfying. Many of them don't go to the next at all.

509
01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:44.540
Sowmya A: Well, okay, good.

510
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.520
Sowmya A: And you also agree that most students will be using trial and error, method and error.

511
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.580
Aarthy B: Yeah, sir.

512
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.069
Sowmya A: Okay. Okay.

513
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.340
Sowmya A: Thank you.

514
01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.389
Sowmya A: Room number 4.

515
01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.159
Sowmya A: Samar Rouhani. Vidya.

516
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.860
Sowmya A: Okay.

517
01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:11.310
Roohani Sareen: Yes, sir, so correct answer as it is option d

518
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:20.139
Roohani Sareen: so what I have thought is one approach can be taking an example. For example, if students take negative 4

519
01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:25.940
Roohani Sareen: and they will perform all the operations which are given in the options.

520
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:42.520
Roohani Sareen: and I mean the misconception can be, they might think that the numbers on the left of 0, on the number line, which are relatively away from 0 are larger than the ones which are nearer to 0, so that can be a misconception if the foundation is not that strong.

521
01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:48.869
Sowmya A: So what about when they take a negative value? What if

522
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:56.459
Sowmya A: looking at option? C. How do they know whether to take minus 4 or minus one, because it could. The negative number could lie on.

523
01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:07.050
Roohani Sareen: So when? Yeah, when we introduce integers. So we also tell the concept of absolute value, the modulus.

524
01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:32.279
Roohani Sareen: So we like personally, when, whenever I introduce this concept, I always am giving one example of when you're going from Bangalore to Mysore, the distance is, let's say, like 150 kilometers. But when you're coming back from Mysore to Bangalore, do you take negative 150 kilometers? So I always give this example that distances are always positive.

525
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:47.619
Roohani Sareen: It's only the you know direction. So I also give an example of the difference between speed and velocity. Speed will only tell you. You know the magnitude and the velocity will tell you the magnitude plus the direction.

526
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:57.799
Roohani Sareen: So if that foundation is clear, I don't think there will be a problem in this question. But provided this cons, I mean foundation is clear.

527
01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:03.519
Sowmya A: So what you're suggesting is, students will actually 1st divide using absolute values

528
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.920
Sowmya A: and then apply the sign to the result.

529
01:07:06.298 --> 01:07:08.189
Roohani Sareen: No, sir! No, no, no.

530
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:12.969
Roohani Sareen: No, no, they can directly apply minus 4 only

531
01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.440
Roohani Sareen: not just not just the magnitude.

532
01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:23.100
Sowmya A: So why not minus one? Why won't they choose minus one? Because that's also to the left of 0.

533
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:23.460
Roohani Sareen: Yeah.

534
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.559
Sowmya A: It's magnitude wise. It is lesser than 2.

535
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:31.499
Roohani Sareen: Yeah, that is what should be clear to students that we are not taking the magnitude only.

536
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:31.910
Sowmya A: Page.

537
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:38.000
Roohani Sareen: We are taking the direction, because in the question itself it's saying to the left of 0, it is showing.

538
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:38.920
Sowmya A: Hmm.

539
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:40.210
Roohani Sareen: Yeah.

540
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.449
Sowmya A: Okay, so good. Thank you.

541
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:46.960
Sowmya A: Room 5.

542
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.320
Sowmya A: Madura preeta.

543
01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:59.559
Madhura shetty: Yes, sir, yes, sir, we also felt children might answer this by trial and error method, by considering Delta to be a particular, taking it as some integer negative integer

544
01:08:00.063 --> 01:08:23.740
Madhura shetty: but otherwise I don't think at this level they will be that much grown enough to understand that negative integer. I agree that they have to understand that negative integer. When you divide by 2, the value is going to be smaller, not bigger. But I don't think at this age they will be that capable to understand, they may only use trial and error, method.

545
01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:27.010
Sowmya A: And hmm, okay.

546
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:28.919
Madhura shetty: If you're able.

547
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:48.740
Madhura shetty: If we are able to drive in that concept in their head, then we are really successful, like a negative number. When you divide by 2, it's going to be smaller when you multiply by 2. Also, it's going to be negative number. When you divide by 2. It's going to be bigger and multiply by 2. It's going to be smaller than that.

548
01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:56.399
Sowmya A: Hmm, okay. But then it might change right whether that limited number is.

549
01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:58.659
Madhura shetty: Yeah, what if?

550
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.970
Sowmya A: Minus one or minus 4. Yeah.

551
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.319
Madhura shetty: Have another doubt. What if it is negative into negative? Again.

552
01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:08.209
Sowmya A: So minus 3, suppose it is minus 3 into minus 3.

553
01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.420
Sowmya A: Okay.

554
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.629
Madhura shetty: Then how do we explain that.

555
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:33.650
Sowmya A: Exactly. What? What do you think if we'll come to that in a moment? But then, yeah, what I'm trying to get at is, can we have like a single approach which students can take, and they are always sure that it will always give them the right answer, and they don't have to look at multiple methods, each

556
01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:39.970
Sowmya A: for a particular scenario that for a particular scenario one approach works, but it doesn't work for all scenarios.

557
01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:41.409
Madhura shetty: Other approach exactly.

558
01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:46.710
Sowmya A: Yeah, then that creates confusion. There should be just one method which should work all the time.

559
01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:47.660
Madhura shetty: Exactly.

560
01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:49.539
Sowmya A: Yeah.

561
01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:57.489
Sowmya A: So similarly so, for example, if Delta, some student was taking Delta as minus one instead of minus 4,

562
01:09:58.029 --> 01:10:02.629
Sowmya A: then minus one by 2 is

563
01:10:02.849 --> 01:10:05.149
Sowmya A: basically to the right of minus 2.

564
01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:05.960
Madhura shetty: Yeah.

565
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:14.519
Sowmya A: Which is lesser than which is greater than minus 2. If you take minus. Yeah, if you take minus 4

566
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.839
Sowmya A: by 2, it's to the left, or it's equal to minus 2 or greater than minus 4.

567
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:28.600
Sowmya A: So then, there, with this type of example that they are taking by trial and error, they may get 2 different results

568
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:36.660
Sowmya A: that creates ambiguity in their minds. Trial and error may work sometimes, but not all the time.

569
01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:41.249
Roohani Sareen: Us if you mention, you know a condition

570
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:48.129
Roohani Sareen: in the question that we are talking only about integers, because minus one by 2 will tend towards rational numbers.

571
01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:48.900
Sowmya A: Hmm.

572
01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:56.190
Roohani Sareen: So if we put a condition that that number has to be an integer only I think that confusion can be clarified.

573
01:10:57.083 --> 01:11:14.500
Radha Sharma: Sir, I think if we are, get means clearing the concept of negative integers again. And the operation means, for example, if I'm not taking trial and error also in this case in this question.

574
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:26.960
Radha Sharma: So when we are subtracting anything, it is decreasing, we have to give them the concept that when we are going away from 0 in the left hand side, then it is always a value which is lesser.

575
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:36.980
Radha Sharma: So if I'm subtracting again, the value will be means, the number will decrease, and if number is decreasing in negative points is value will increase.

576
01:11:37.030 --> 01:12:06.120
Radha Sharma: so it will come towards the absolute. It will come nearer to 0. Same with the division. If we are dividing it again, the value, the number is decreasing, and the value will come closer to 0. Even in addition, also, addition is already coming to 0, coming nearer to 0. So only in multiplication as it is a repeated addition. So again and again, when we are taking negative numbers, so it is going away from 0. So that will be the lesser value than the given value.

577
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.079
Radha Sharma: So I think that concept map may help.

578
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:25.299
Sowmya A: Yeah. So I think, thank you all for your inputs. What I'm hearing. And if I just summarize, and I feel it might be true also that the context becomes important. Some students might be more comfortable with some concepts. So, for example, so far they've been doing

579
01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:46.400
Sowmya A: whole number, multiplication, whole number division right, and then suddenly to move to negative numbers and then negative number, multiplication division. Although the logic might be pretty easy to understand, or the algorithm might be very simple, but context has not been built enough. And there are very few real life examples that you can give, because

580
01:12:46.740 --> 01:13:01.960
Sowmya A: I think just going back to my point. We probably invented negative numbers because we saw some limitations with positive numbers, and otherwise we could have just worked with positive numbers throughout. I mean, if you look at the number system.

581
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:28.050
Sowmya A: we could have just made our reference point instead of 0, we could have made it minus infinity or minus some value. So then everything would have been positive. So for every negative number there can be an equivalent positive number which might actually suit our purpose, but we possibly created negative numbers just like we did fractions where we found that since our usual way of measurement

582
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:39.609
Sowmya A: already assumes moving from 0 to positive numbers or tangible things. Negative concept was not given a lot of importance, but it was required for us to do math.

583
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.219
Sowmya A: So that's why you real life. Examples of negative

584
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:47.599
Sowmya A: values might not be as frequent in their daily lives

585
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.500
Sowmya A: as say positive things, and that might be one of the reasons why why students might struggle when they encounter negative things.

586
01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:08.720
Sowmya A: So for negative numbers, it might actually be useful to develop some algorithms and say, when you are working with negative numbers. You can switch to some algorithm, not because

587
01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:35.760
Sowmya A: that, they can't use pure logic or pure understanding, but maybe because their mind is not conditioned enough with examples that they are readily able to use negative numbers as quickly as possible. So just going back to what Madura was saying or what Rouhani was saying is maybe for negative numbers. We can look at absolute values.

588
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.999
Sowmya A: do the division and then apply the sign?

589
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:49.349
Sowmya A: Then they might be able to recognize the value very quickly rather than trying to think of that. A negative number divided by

590
01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:53.920
Sowmya A: another number, positive number actually increases its value.

591
01:14:54.250 --> 01:15:07.609
Sowmya A: Because what if it's an improper fraction? And what if it's a proper fraction? What happens in that case? So there will be multiple scenarios that may come up. And just to avoid that, maybe we can think of this concept of

592
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.750
Sowmya A: taking the absolute values.

593
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:24.529
Sowmya A: performing the division or multiplication and then applying the sign to it that might also give them some sense of no satisfaction, that it is not different from natural number, multiplication, or division.

594
01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:51.450
Ranjith P C: So can just a point here. What point we are driving here is, for example, in my, when I was a student, I remember the way my teacher taught. I think most of the case. Most of us here would have learned like that if it is 3 minus 5. My teacher taught me very simple. You subtract a smaller number from the bigger number and put the sign of the bigger number. That is simply a logic. That is not the concept

595
01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:57.849
Ranjith P C: absolutely, absolutely out of the concept. It's not at all a concept. It is wholly to help the child.

596
01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:06.289
Ranjith P C: and especially the all the learners starting from the top learners to the bottom learners. I mean the slow learners that logic will work.

597
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:30.419
Ranjith P C: Okay, that logic will work. But when the child has to learn the concept. It has to be taught in the very primary level concept. You have 3 chocolates. You need to take away 5 chocolates, which is not possible. Then what you do. That is where the idea of counters or your buttons come into picture, and from there you scaffold them and move on, and that's where the idea of lack will come

598
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:53.970
Ranjith P C: which we already discussed. The deficit. We don't have it. We don't have. We have lack of 2 more chocolate. So the lack of 2 more chocolate is going to give you that minus 2. The sense of bringing minus 2 is coming from the lack the word lack, or you take away, you remove. You don't have it. You do those things. So that is that idea of, you know, taking away or remove

599
01:16:53.970 --> 01:17:07.459
Ranjith P C: the basic subtraction concept that is actually the conceptual approach which is used, I mean, which we scaffolded through the buttons or the number line. As the child progress in their, you know, year of learning.

600
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:23.020
Ranjith P C: Okay, so. But what we are trying to tell right now is absolute value. Take the absolute value and put the sign later on is a kind of you know, supporting the child, and you know, so that they don't make errors in the examination.

601
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.819
Ranjith P C: But we are not actually helping the child in

602
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:45.450
Ranjith P C: getting the concept as as such. So the point which you initially they are in your 1st slide itself shows that you know the idea that the buttons which you've showed and the idea which you've shown, the lack and deficit ideas that is, slowly. I would say, it's a stepping stone for the child to learn, you know.

603
01:17:45.830 --> 01:18:10.739
Ranjith P C: towards the concept learning, and we should definitely bring in the idea of, you know, the primary concept itself, because you don't jump into addition. Sorry multiplication and division in indiger. 1st you start from, you know, 1st indiger, what is integer? Then you move on to ordering and representation of integer. Okay, then you move on to ordering and comparison of integers. Okay, that is where.

604
01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:22.650
Ranjith P C: in one of your option is in the question which you shown Delta into 2. The child particularly. Most of them, will not pick it up. I am, I am assuming why they are not picking that up, because for them

605
01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:44.900
Ranjith P C: multiply with the number, it would increase the number, so they don't understand that Delta is in the negative side. If you multiply it by 2, it is again a repeated addition which move further away from Delta, and as you move away from Delta, or as you move away from 0 in the negative direction, the value reduces that comparison part is also lacking in the child.

606
01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:54.060
Ranjith P C: So point the bottom line. The summary which I I understand. I I would like to tell everyone in this room

607
01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:18.549
Ranjith P C: so is that you know absolute value concept is to help the children. That's not the concept concept has to be taught the way it is being taught in the primary class for subtraction, multiplication, and all. Then they have to move on with that thing. That's what my view into that thing it is. It is good to go with definitely the absolute value, so that they don't make errors, and they become confident.

608
01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:34.000
Ranjith P C: They become confident, because they do 10 problems in the classroom. They they go with that sense, they will, they will definitely be confident, then the teacher can slowly introduce this one, but you know it will no go. It will not go hand in hand. That is a problem.

609
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.060
Sowmya A: Any other. Anyone else wants to share anything.

610
01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:41.690
Sowmya A: Thank you for that, Randy.

611
01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:49.729
Sowmya A: Okay, so let's just look at some stats around

612
01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.920
Sowmya A: what happened and how students fared on this one.

613
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:59.910
Sowmya A: So yeah, about 41%. Again, we see that 40.

614
01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:03.020
Ranjith P C: Can you share your screen? Sorry. Sorry. Can you share your screen?

615
01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.229
Sowmya A: Oh, my notes here.

616
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.070
Sowmya A: okay, yeah, can you? All of you see my screen?

617
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:17.950
Sowmya A: Yeah.

618
01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:28.389
Sowmya A: So basically, it says, 41% again, around that 40% mark we see who got it right and most common wrong answer was a

619
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:36.200
Sowmya A: so again followed by very surprisingly, she was the last choice. So.

620
01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:49.600
Sowmya A: although we had that keyword, less students seem to have, either they have seemed understood it, or there might be another error which is there in their misconception in their minds, which for which

621
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:54.390
Sowmya A: they did not choose. C. Although it would seem that if

622
01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:02.919
Sowmya A: a misconception of negative number division is there, this should have been the dominant choice or the dominant wrong answer. It's not the case

623
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:14.459
Sowmya A: so he might have to think of what what other points might have been there in their minds of the child, so that they did not choose C as one of their options, and

624
01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:41.200
Sowmya A: a seems to be very dominant. So I think what it shows is the concept of addition subtraction, because they do so much of it has a dominance in their minds, even when they're looking at an answer. And that misconception probably plays a stronger role than the concept of division, which I think they're still not very confident about. So that's why the most common wrong answer turns out to be A instead of C.

625
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.949
Sowmya A: Any thoughts.

626
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:57.640
krithika S: Sorry to interrupt. I think so. Even they have seen this word less than they normally use it this word in subtraction, so subtracting 2 numbers, they use this less than so that is also a case where they choose. This.

627
01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:14.419
Sowmya A: Yeah. So just on that point, although division also, they understand as being less as being reducing something. But is it that a was the 1st option. Hence they picked that, and if C. Had been the 1st option they would have picked C.

628
01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.149
Sowmya A: I don't know. Go.

629
01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:28.009
Ranjith P C: Even 2 minus delta anywhere in this particular option, I would say that they will choose 2 minus delta, first, st because.

630
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.799
latha sriram: I do agree with him. This correct, they.

631
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.589
latha sriram: whatever you keep, they will not consider C. Option. That's very rare.

632
01:22:35.590 --> 01:23:01.940
Ranjith P C: Yeah, see, option is very secondary thing. I mean it is, it is making. But, as you said, addition, subtraction is so rigid in the child's mind know that operation. They do. A lot of operations, regard and multiplication and division come later, correct. So this less. And the word problem kind of the kind of word problem they do much more, much less. All these things know that will play a major role, and the child will automatically pick up that

633
01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.169
Ranjith P C: wherever you keep they'll choose that.

634
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:09.469
Madhura shetty: They would have thought it as 2 less than Delta also.

635
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.489
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, I think makes sense makes sense

636
01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:16.810
Sowmya A: good. Any other thought from anyone.

637
01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:26.539
Sowmya A: So I think, how can this be addressed? What? Any like very key points.

638
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:34.219
Sowmya A: Maybe just 1 point on what might be the most important thing if you have to address this kind of a misconception among students.

639
01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:50.000
Ranjith P C: See, 1st thing is, the child should know the number line, what? Where the numbers are placed, and what is the, you know value of that number which represents on the negative side or positive side. What does it actually means?

640
01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:13.779
Ranjith P C: Okay, that sense has to be there. That means whether you call it direction, whether you call it the absolute value, the value, the number line sense of bringing the number line itself is very important towards the left of 0. What's happening to the number towards the right of 0? What's happening to the number? What you? What will happen if you do? Certain operation? Those ideas should be there before that itself.

641
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.110
Ranjith P C: This number line.

642
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:40.180
Ranjith P C: you know, before you introduce the number line, the idea of, you know, integer, integer, addition, subtraction. All those operations have to be introduced through the way we pulled the counters and buttons and things like that, because they should get some sense of it, because number line, when you move into a number line, become bit abstract for the child, because the child may not entertain. Everybody may not entertain that thing. Okay, though, though they will be able to understand

643
01:24:40.180 --> 01:25:03.609
Ranjith P C: simple addition and subtraction. But the way you scaffold them from the buttons concept to this thing that plays a major role and placing the number and what the value represent towards the left and right of the number line. That also plays a major that has to be introduced to the child introduced to the child in a way you know, much, much concrete manner, so that

644
01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:09.410
Ranjith P C: the child will at least take, I mean, take off from there, and they don't make much mistake in the.

645
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.700
Sowmya A: Yeah, precisely.

646
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:12.880
Radha Sharma: Sure. Thank you.

647
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.560
Sowmya A: Yeah. Go. Ahead. Sorry.

648
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.729
Radha Sharma: Sir, I want to ask one question.

649
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:36.989
Radha Sharma: Actually, when we were talking about trial and error method, and when we were talking about that, we can take any negative value. Learner can take any negative value in place of Delta, and then they can try. So why, you were talking about minus one and minus 4. How is how it will make difference? It will be same, I think.

650
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:48.610
Sowmya A: It won't. Yeah, yeah, it won't. I'm just saying in their minds when they say Take something which is magnitude wise, greater than 2. So you're dividing by 2, right? So supposing their example that they took was minus one.

651
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:49.899
Sowmya A: so it becomes minor.

652
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:56.340
Radha Sharma: Any negative number, any negative number. If they are taking, so it will always be means they will get the result properly.

653
01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:59.250
Sowmya A: Correct. Correct. What I'm saying is in their mind.

654
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:18.819
Sowmya A: 4 by 2, if you take right, 4 by 2 is greater than one, whereas one by 2. Magnitude wise is lesser than one, so do they have the understanding of minus 4 by 2, and minus one by 2. So what is the meaning of a negative number in case of fractions?

655
01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:30.550
Sowmya A: Do they have that understanding or not? Or do they get confused with that logic also integers versus fractions in negative numbers? Do they have that understanding? Is what I wanted to highlight.

656
01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.609
Radha Sharma: Thank you, sir.

657
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.650
Chitra Mohan: Okay, so I have a doubt.

658
01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:38.089
Chitra Mohan: sir. I have a doubt, sir.

659
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:39.160
Sowmya A: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

660
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.179
Chitra Mohan: Hello, sir!

661
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:41.730
Sowmya A: Can you hear?

662
01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:53.760
Chitra Mohan: Randy, Sir said, write that number line, but rather than number line it is with, the reference is better. Why? Because when I go for a vertical number line.

663
01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:18.860
Chitra Mohan: The chain may interpret it differently. You have given an horizontal number line when I teach them with the reference or something, then, when I draw the number line in any direction, there is no rule that it has to be that gives a lead to even the graph where they have the x-axis and y-axis. When both vertical and horizontal are taught, it is not only to the left and right, it is to the up and down also

664
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:29.999
Chitra Mohan: when they have that sense. No, that will be even more better in understanding this, and it'll be much easier when you go to higher classes to introduce X access, and via access.

665
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:43.810
Ranjith P C: That's the point here, all with reference to 0 towards the left and right, what's happening to the number? So that's what we no matter you put it in vertical or horizontal. How.

666
01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:51.850
Chitra Mohan: No, sir, it changes few children, they take it as left and right. I have tested it when I give a vertical.

667
01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:52.260
Ranjith P C: Hi!

668
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:57.480
Ranjith P C: No, no, yeah. I I understood totally. I got.

669
01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.890
Chitra Mohan: Where are you coming from? Yes.

670
01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:01.730
Ranjith P C: Towards the towards the top, and towards the bottom.

671
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:02.209
Chitra Mohan: We are.

672
01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:06.670
Ranjith P C: So we we take the sea level sea level towards the To, you know, in depth.

673
01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:12.780
Chitra Mohan: They even speak about C. 11, and it is not when it comes to graph. No, they get so confused.

674
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:19.309
Chitra Mohan: What and what number? If the number line is just here properly either vertical or horizontal, flip it up.

675
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:24.959
Chitra Mohan: it aids them in like it helps them a lot in introducing.

676
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:48.810
Ranjith P C: So that is, that is where the scaffolding is required. So initial point, which even Sokin also mentioned about that. You know the all these examples, you know, which you take it up. You know you also mentioned in the reference. I remember saying that you know on the sea level submarine all those concepts you brought in. Correct, you know, submarine. With respect to submarine below the submarine, it is going to be a negative, and above it is positive.

677
01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:49.979
Chitra Mohan: Put the level to C level.

678
01:28:49.980 --> 01:29:02.480
Ranjith P C: Yeah, with the level to sea level, correct with the level to sea level. So with respect to sea level, so that that sense has to be into, I mean introduced first, st then, only the number line will make sense to the children. So with respect

679
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:02.939
Ranjith P C: good to see you.

680
01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.749
Suchita Kadambi: I want to give an easier example, sir, when you go in the lift ground floor is a.

681
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:08.590
Ranjith P C: Oh!

682
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:13.590
Suchita Kadambi: Okay, whenever you want to go to the higher flows, they're all positive numbers in the list. When you want.

683
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:14.080
Ranjith P C: Correct.

684
01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.200
Suchita Kadambi: It is minus one, so that.

685
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:16.730
Ranjith P C: Absolutely, is.

686
01:29:16.730 --> 01:29:17.230
Suchita Kadambi: Because.

687
01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:40.900
Ranjith P C: Absolutely absolutely, because children travel these days across, you know, into the malls and all when they go into the basement parking. With respect to the ground level ground level. If you are ground floor, you take it as 0 or ground level is your reference point. As Chitra, ma'am said. Below that you go into the basement. It is going to be negative and move up. It's positive all these things are initial.

688
01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:50.730
Ranjith P C: When you introduce the concept of indigenous. You use all this scaffolding techniques, basically, or the examples you use it to bring the sense of

689
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:57.299
Ranjith P C: moving away from the you know. Reference point up and down. What's happening to the numbers.

690
01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:58.970
Sowmya A: Yeah.

691
01:29:59.486 --> 01:30:00.519
Chitra Mohan: Hello, sir!

692
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:09.339
Chitra Mohan: I have one more doubt. That was my doubt when it comes to horizontal. If the same question is given in horizontal, how will the answers differ.

693
01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:26.090
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, just 1 point on that. What I want to mention is this is something I mentioned in my 1st session as well, that context is really important for children. So logically, both are the same, absolutely no issues. But.

694
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:27.929
Chitra Mohan: They don't think in that way that way.

695
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:47.640
Sowmya A: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to come to. What I'm trying to say is that if you start with some context that most children have familiarity with. For example, if when you go along on your daily life rarely, you will see things flying up in the air or going into the crowd, but you will see things moving left and right, cars, moving trains, moving, cycles moving.

696
01:30:47.640 --> 01:31:05.250
Chitra Mohan: Why I have asked you is, whenever I asked about the vertical distance, the children end up doing it wrong, similar to this question, since it is horizontal, you're given. When it comes to vertical distance, they end up in subtracting and giving a lower one. And actually they don't understand the exact meaning of vertical distance.

697
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:31.040
Sowmya A: Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to come to. What I'm saying is, maybe we use horizontal number line, because that is what we see most commonly in our daily lives, left and right, rather than moving up and down, so it might be a good starting point to introduce these numbers, line or integer concept, because they already are familiar with it. You may have to give them some guidance, and then they will use their own intuition and then pick it up from there

698
01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:40.729
Sowmya A: from their daily experiences that they have. Whereas if you give an example of something going up and down, which is rarely they will watch a rocket going up, or something like that. They may be.

699
01:31:40.730 --> 01:31:42.039
Chitra Mohan: It goes up and down, sir.

700
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:42.520
Sowmya A: Very good.

701
01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.270
Chitra Mohan: An elevator goes up and down.

702
01:31:44.270 --> 01:32:01.580
Sowmya A: Very true, very true, elevator does, but how much do they see of an elevator in a day, rather than watching a cycle or a person moving left and right on a road or things. So if you look at the relative probability, it might be that left and right is maybe more probable than.

703
01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.620
Chitra Mohan: More probable than the up and down.

704
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:04.750
Sowmya A: But but.

705
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:12.869
Chitra Mohan: Sky campus lift is also more. These days. It has become more apparent in every building.

706
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:25.610
Sowmya A: Correct. So that's why the probably the next obvious example for up and down is the elevator. Because that's the next most common thing children view, rather than saying that if I take a space shuttle to Mars, or come back, or something.

707
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:29.509
Chitra Mohan: Yes, or when I say mine shaft, they ask me, what is a mine shaft, ma'am?

708
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.050
Sowmya A: Yeah, so.

709
01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:52.360
Suchita Kadambi: Ma'am, I would also like to add that we also introduce them to some words like we say, profit is positive, loss is negative. So all those keywords we give them. Okay, increase in temperature is positive. Decrease in temperature is negative. So all those keywords we initially teach them, and we introduce them to intelligence.

710
01:32:54.150 --> 01:33:24.070
Sowmya A: I think this was good. I think it's a good discussion, and I think it's a discussion that requires more thought as well. And it's probably an ongoing discussion. There will always be better ways of doing things. But I think the key key summary would be if we use concepts that students are familiar with. I think it might be an easier task to help them, and logically, all the examples mentioned by everyone are valid. But I think. Let's just be conscious of

711
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:37.970
Sowmya A: what might students be more familiar with and work on towards building concepts on top of those, then it might be an easier journey for them. One example that I have is from because we are on this topic

712
01:33:37.970 --> 01:34:02.320
Sowmya A: is from the list of resources that are shared. Some of you might have already gone through this document, which is quite a nice document. Here. It introduces the concept of integer multiplication, using a grid. I think some of you might already be using it, but I felt it might be nice to just show it to the, to the panel over here, in case some of you get ideas. So they start from the number line, and this has both

713
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:22.139
Sowmya A: horizontal number line and vertical number line, and then you are multiplying numbers. And you see, as we go from left to right, how the numbers keep changing and they decrease. So even the product keeps changing, based on that. So every element in this is the product of the corresponding row value and the column value.

714
01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:44.350
Sowmya A: And when students keep populating this, they also get not only an idea about number line, but also of quadrants in. And then it's an introduction into coordinate geometry. So I felt that this is a really nice exercise that students might do in for them to understand how multiplication signs work with integers.

715
01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:59.470
Sowmya A: And this is in the resources folder. I've provided a link to this in the excel, and you can readily access this from there. It's a quite good reading and quite worth.

716
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:07.090
Sowmya A: So yeah, so this was one example that I just wanted to share which you can use in your classes.

717
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:13.189
Sowmya A: Let's let's just go back, and you can read through this document in your at your own pace as well.

718
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:24.620
Sowmya A: So I'm just conscious of the time as well. Let's just look at what we've done so far.

719
01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:39.909
Sowmya A: Yeah. So I think we all understood that number line is probably key for students to understand integer operations that includes subtraction, multiplication, division, and addition.

720
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.200
Sowmya A: and having a good grounding of that might help them. Now.

721
01:35:45.040 --> 01:36:02.949
Sowmya A: I want to introduce one more concept or one more approach of looking at this. And then. And this is the vector, approach. I'm not. Some of you may be familiar with it. Some of you may not be. Which again, the benefit of that is, we've been talking directions a lot when we were looking at negative numbers. So

722
01:36:03.288 --> 01:36:23.580
Sowmya A: the obvious sort of outcome of that, is it vectors and an understanding of vectors. And in the case of vectors we may view these slightly differently, and then I will leave it up to you to decide which approach works best for you. But it's just a concept. And then for you to look at and think about.

723
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:28.689
Sowmya A: So when, before we start that I'll just come back to my 1st slide.

724
01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:38.299
Sowmya A: So in this slide, supposing, I say, that the temporary, the temperature is 20 degrees centigrade.

725
01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:45.459
Sowmya A: Right? So all of you would say, Okay, that means it. With respect to 0, if the temperature is 20 degrees Centi.

726
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:50.060
Sowmya A: Now, if I say the change in temperature is 20 degrees centigrade.

727
01:36:50.780 --> 01:37:05.070
Sowmya A: right? Both of them, when I write on a piece of paper, I'll write 20 degrees centigrade or 20 right? But they mean 2 different things. If I say that the change in temperature is 20 degrees centigrade. It could still be negative.

728
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:06.330
Sowmya A: right?

729
01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:13.040
Sowmya A: Because I could have gone from 0 to minus 20. The change is still 20 degrees Centig

730
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:22.020
Sowmya A: right, or I could have gone from 0 to 20 right? But if I say my temperature is 20 degrees centigrade, it cannot mean 2 different things.

731
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.589
Sowmya A: So one is an indication of a state.

732
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:30.190
Sowmya A: whereas the other is an indicator of change.

733
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:36.609
Sowmya A: So these are 2 quite different things, yet we are denoting both of them with the same number.

734
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:42.720
Sowmya A: Am I making sense so far? Does does that make sense so far.

735
01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:55.009
Ranjith P C: Yeah. And I think so. Can one just point 1 point here change with respect to what do we do you mention about that, or it is simply the change.

736
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:58.389
Sowmya A: Does so does change require a reference point.

737
01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.080
Ranjith P C: That's a that's a whole point. Here.

738
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:19.669
Sowmya A: Yeah. So that's where we get into the I won't get into vectors, because that's a more advanced concept. But I'm just introducing this because it very seamlessly leads into this vector operations later, and where everything is in a vector in math and physics. But

739
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:31.449
Sowmya A: the same concepts are being used at the primary or the middle school level as well, and I just wanted to highlight that. So when we talk about change, it does not require a reference point.

740
01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:40.439
Sowmya A: it can move about freely anywhere, whereas when I say a state like 20 degrees and a temperature is 20 degrees centigrade.

741
01:38:40.550 --> 01:39:00.499
Sowmya A: it can. It can only mean that the temperature is 20 degrees, whereas if I say 20 degree centigrade change, the temperature could be negative. The change could be from 0 to minus 20, or the change could be 0 to plus 20 right? Just saying that the change is 20 degrees. Centigrade is not enough to tell you what the temperature is

742
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.580
Sowmya A: right.

743
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:08.280
Sowmya A: So now, based on that, what I can say is that when we look at addition

744
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:13.360
Sowmya A: integer addition, we can think of it as a particular state

745
01:39:13.630 --> 01:39:15.570
Sowmya A: and adding a change to it.

746
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:18.669
Sowmya A: Okay, let's just look at some examples.

747
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:28.359
Sowmya A: So say, I have the number 3 over here. Okay? And I add minus 5 to it. Okay, so this is my number line.

748
01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:30.489
Sowmya A: I start with 3.

749
01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:37.560
Sowmya A: Okay? And what is my change? My change is minus 5. That means I have to go left from 3.

750
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:41.870
Sowmya A: So left from 3. If I go minus 5, I come to minus 2.

751
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:51.490
Sowmya A: So initial state, like my temperature is 0 degree centigrade, plus the change change of minus

752
01:39:51.720 --> 01:40:00.240
Sowmya A: 5 degree centigrade will make it minus. So the initial state, plus the change will give me my final state

753
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.990
Sowmya A: right?

754
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:07.339
Sowmya A: So the change in itself cannot mean anything. It can only it. It cannot give you a

755
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:22.499
Sowmya A: a position that I am at right, but coupled with another state, I can tell it can become a position. Right? So in this case, 3 plus a negative change of 5 gives me negative 2.

756
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:30.500
Sowmya A: Okay, let's see if it works with any other scenario also. So I did 3 plus minus 5. What if I do?

757
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:38.269
Sowmya A: 5 mine plus or 5 plus minus 3.

758
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.160
Sowmya A: Supposing I do this?

759
01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:46.939
Sowmya A: Okay? So now, what is my initial state file? This is what I started with.

760
01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:52.019
Sowmya A: And to that I'm adding, what change? Because plus means adding a change.

761
01:40:52.160 --> 01:41:03.949
Sowmya A: So what am I adding to it? Minus 3. So 5 plus minus 3 gives me. That means from 5 I have to go left because it's a negative change. So 5 plus minus 3 gives me

762
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:04.800
Sowmya A: 2.

763
01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:09.389
Sowmya A: Okay, now, let's come back to say a more difficult scenario.

764
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:14.360
Sowmya A: right? Minus 5 minus minus 3.

765
01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:15.790
Sowmya A: Okay?

766
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.920
Sowmya A: So plus is what plus is

767
01:41:19.110 --> 01:41:30.849
Sowmya A: adding a change to an existing state. Right? So let me let me just take another scenario, so that we are very clear that it works in all possible scenarios. What about minus 5 plus minus 3?

768
01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.230
Sowmya A: Right? Let's see if it works for that.

769
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.360
Sowmya A: So my initial state is minus 5

770
01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.569
Sowmya A: right? Which is on this side.

771
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:43.909
Sowmya A: To that I'm adding a change. That means a negative change. That means I'm going further. Left.

772
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:49.879
Sowmya A: So minus 5 plus minus 3 gives me minus 8. So that gives me another state.

773
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:55.389
Sowmya A: Okay, now let's see if it were what happens with negative note.

774
01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:07.200
Sowmya A: So if adding is giving you a state right, initial state plus change final state? Okay, what is subtraction?

775
01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:14.110
Sowmya A: Subtraction is the change. Why? Because if I say that my temperature was 25 degrees

776
01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:22.120
Sowmya A: now, and my temperature earlier was 20 degrees 25 minus 20 gives me change.

777
01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:29.709
Sowmya A: Okay, so now, I might be redefining how we say, look at addition and subtraction.

778
01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:33.699
Sowmya A: So sub addition is basically giving us a state.

779
01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:38.270
Sowmya A: whereas subtraction is actually always giving us change.

780
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:44.470
Sowmya A: Okay, so what is the change? Right? So let's see if that works. So if I have 5

781
01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:52.200
Sowmya A: and I have minus sorry, it would be minus 3.

782
01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:57.040
Sowmya A: Very easy. But let's see if we can view it in terms of the definition that I was just saying

783
01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:01.170
Sowmya A: so. I'm saying 5 is my initial state.

784
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:04.540
Sowmya A: and 3, 5 is my final state.

785
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:16.370
Sowmya A: and 3 was my initial state. So 5. How do I go? From 3 to 5, from my initial state to my final state. I go. I have to go to the right. So that's why it's plus 2

786
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:25.960
Sowmya A: right. And that is what that is the change. It is not the state, it's the change. So subtraction is always change. How much did it change by

787
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:33.159
Sowmya A: right? Now? Supposing let me take another example, does it work for negative? No, if I take minus 5,

788
01:43:33.330 --> 01:43:39.350
Sowmya A: minus 3, right? So what was my initial state? 3.

789
01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.779
Sowmya A: And from 3 I went to minus 5.

790
01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:47.890
Sowmya A: So how do I go? From 3 to minus 5?

791
01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:53.560
Sowmya A: I have to go minus 8. So my change is minus 8, right?

792
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:59.760
Sowmya A: So it works for every scenario. What if I say minus 5, minus minus 3?

793
01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:01.839
Sowmya A: Let's see if it works in this scenario.

794
01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.619
Sowmya A: So my initial state is minus 3

795
01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:10.480
Sowmya A: right, and then from minus 3, I have to go to minus 5.

796
01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:15.769
Sowmya A: So I have to go to the left. That means I miss subtract. So my change is minus 2.

797
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:31.780
Sowmya A: So do you see that it is independent of having to interpret signs? I don't have to think about minus into minus is plus plus into minus is minus. Whether minus comes before minus comes after. It's just always consistent, because

798
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:36.819
Sowmya A: subtraction measures change. That's it. Nothing else.

799
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.159
Sowmya A: Subtraction always measures change.

800
01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.949
Sowmya A: So it works with every possible scenario.

801
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:54.079
Sowmya A: right? And then we can keep changing the values over here. But we can all. It's the definition is always consistent. There are no exceptions, you can always get the right answer. With this approach

802
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:57.770
Sowmya A: the only thing is the definition, addition

803
01:44:58.050 --> 01:45:03.030
Sowmya A: is state going from one state plus. The change gives you the final state.

804
01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:06.550
Sowmya A: Subtraction gives you the change, only the change

805
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:18.110
Sowmya A: right? And using this, you may well ask like difficult questions like, How do I explain? Minus of minus 3 know a number before that? How do I just explain, minus of minus 3? Let's just see.

806
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:24.170
Sowmya A: So when I say, minus of minus 3 default is 0, right?

807
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:32.209
Sowmya A: So my final state is 0, and I start with minus 3. So how do I go from minus 3 to 0.

808
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:33.620
Sowmya A: I add 3.

809
01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.069
Sowmya A: So minus of minus 3 is plus 3, which is again change.

810
01:45:39.490 --> 01:45:40.340
Sowmya A: Okay?

811
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:59.879
Sowmya A: Again, I know this might be different from what you might be familiar with. It's just a perspective, a thought and it's built on this concept of direction that some of you are using in your in your explanation. So what I'm saying is, there is merit in using direction as well. But

812
01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:20.659
Sowmya A: as long as we are able to build context, I think we should be fine, because I know, having taught senior students. Also, I know for a fact that context is really important. So if a student is understanding numbers, using accounting logic like profit and loss. He likes numbers in terms of finance.

813
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:47.680
Sowmya A: profit, and loss concepts. Then, maybe with directions, he might, he or she might have difficulty interpreting. So it's always good to have a nice balance, and also showing that one. These concepts are interchangeable. So the same concept in direction can be moved to finance or vice versa. But we need to be careful that we set the ground in a way that we don't say that

814
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:51.569
Sowmya A: in this scenario. It's an exception. Just remember it this way.

815
01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:54.259
Sowmya A: Okay, for everything else. It works.

816
01:46:54.370 --> 01:47:14.820
Sowmya A: then, that creates doubts in students. Mind. So whatever concept you do end up using. Make sure that the examples that you give can be scalable, and they can be moved into other areas also without having to modify the way that they think or modify the the logic that they've built over a period of time.

817
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.690
Sowmya A: Okay.

818
01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:37.890
Ranjith P C: So we we use this. We use this idea in our schools. But we don't. We don't mention it, as you know, the with the way you mentioned, not the green green color, I mean the changes green. Item 3. Correct, the moving towards the 0. Correct. We we may, we denoted as jump actually in the this way.

819
01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:40.380
Radha Sharma: Yes, we are using.

820
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:51.930
Ranjith P C: Yeah, yeah, it's the same same concept, but only not putting the direction direction is there, but always we put it as a jump from this way or this way, whether moving.

821
01:47:52.270 --> 01:48:06.129
Radha Sharma: Even in our school also, we are using this number line concept for addition and subtraction. But again, we are not using this word change. And we have not explained that what is a change means addition in subtraction and subtraction context.

822
01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:23.799
Radha Sharma: We are only taking. It means, if we are adding a positive number you can see on a number line for adding a positive number. We will always go to a right. Go to right hand side, right? We are moving towards the right hand side. But if we are adding a negative number, we have to go to our left hand side.

823
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:25.840
Radha Sharma: So addition.

824
01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:39.500
Radha Sharma: So that is, the method is given means even we are using a curriculum in which these methods are given. So we are using that number line, adding in subtraction, using number line.

825
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:49.900
Sowmya A: So just on that. Rather, how would you explain this particular scenarios? I'm just curious to understand. Supposing, I say 0 minus minus 3. How would you explain this?

826
01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:52.090
Sowmya A: This confusion? Here.

827
01:48:52.490 --> 01:49:14.819
Radha Sharma: Okay. So what I was telling right now was addition. If we are adding, we are going towards the for adding a positive number, we are going towards the right hand side, and for adding a negative number, we are going towards the left hand side. Same. It is opposite with the subtraction context. So if I am subtracting a positive number, I have to go towards the left hand side.

828
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:15.760
Radha Sharma: So.

829
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:20.910
Sowmya A: And how do you explain? Minus of minus? 3 as being positive? How do you explain that.

830
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:36.090
Radha Sharma: From 0 0 is also in also an integer, so it is subtraction from subtracted from int the 0. So, and when we are subtracting a negative number. We are going towards right hand side. So from 0 we will go 3 more.

831
01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:41.490
Radha Sharma: So it will be positive. 3 means we have to take 3 moves from minus 3. I say.

832
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:55.149
Sowmya A: But then isn't negative associated with left hand side. Just I think you just said that right, that students think that students know that negative minus means going to negative side. But then, how do you explain negative of a negative

833
01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:01.029
Sowmya A: actually becomes possible? How do you conceptually explain that? That's what I'm curious to understand.

834
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:09.209
Radha Sharma: These, both the things are different. It is not negative of negative, it is subtraction of a negative integer from 0.

835
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:12.790
Sowmya A: Hmm, so so then how does that become positive?

836
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:15.089
latha sriram: Sir, can I say something if you don't mind.

837
01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.950
Sowmya A: I can just wait for rather to complete.

838
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:19.036
Sowmya A: Okay, sir.

839
01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.550
Radha Sharma: Okay? So from 0, when we are going towards, see, when we are subtracting a negative integer

840
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:30.030
Radha Sharma: just a minute. What?

841
01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.100
Radha Sharma: Let's see.

842
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.980
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Fine.

843
01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.009
Radha Sharma: Okay. Just just come. Give me one.

844
01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:38.879
Sowmya A: Yeah, you can come back. Yeah, no worries, no worries. Yeah. Sorry.

845
01:50:40.560 --> 01:51:00.009
latha sriram: I just wanted to answer for that only. Actually, it is traction the moment we say minus minus means towards the left. Now, once there is a minus. I have to move towards the left, but again, the number is also having a minus, so I am forced to move towards the right. That is how we explain with number line.

846
01:51:00.170 --> 01:51:17.490
latha sriram: We say that there is a subtraction. I, whenever I see negative sign whether it is symbol or the operation. 1st move towards the left, then another. One time there is on minus. That means again, you have to come towards the right side. That is how we explain with the number line same.

847
01:51:17.490 --> 01:51:29.019
Sowmya A: So basically, so basically, you are explaining that when 2 negative signs are with each other it's going negative. But then negative of a negative becomes the opposite direction, so then it becomes.

848
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:44.360
latha sriram: Yeah, without introducing integer multiplication being in 6 standard, we can't introduce. So we do like this. First, st you see the subtraction sign children move towards the left, but then again, the number is also having a minus sign. Then I have to move towards the right.

849
01:51:45.170 --> 01:51:49.300
Sowmya A: Yeah, I think that seems reasonable for students to understand.

850
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:53.370
Sowmya A: Okay, any other thoughts from anyone.

851
01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:58.620
Sowmya A: Okay, let's just go back.

852
01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:04.949
Sowmya A: And let's do one more question. Maybe we need different breakout rooms for that as well.

853
01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:08.669
Sowmya A: Yeah, in the interest of time.

854
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:11.810
Sowmya A: Where's that?

855
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:14.930
Sowmya A: Shall we look at?

856
01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:28.460
Sowmya A: Yeah. So can we all go back to our breakout rooms and look at this particular question, which is there? I'll I'll start pasting it on the

857
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:34.620
Sowmya A: docs as well. How do I move all of you back to the breakout room.

858
01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.579
Sowmya A: Open all rooms. Okay?

859
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.060
Sowmya A: Yeah. So the rooms are open. You can all go back. I think we have about 5 min, you can take about 5 min or 7 min

860
01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:54.739
Sowmya A: to discuss this particular scenario. I'll paste it in the Google docs as well, so that each of you can see and do that for that. I'll have to minimize this sorry.

861
01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.220
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: Mr. Sulking.

862
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:18.250
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: Good evening, sir. I joined a little late, so you just breakout room for me.

863
01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:19.290
Sowmya A: Yes.

864
01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:22.870
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: With Chitra and Lata, who are from my spot.

865
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:26.064
Sowmya A: Yeah, I think we have assigned

866
01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:29.029
Sowmya A: you to the rules, did you not?

867
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:31.010
Sowmya A: Are you not able to join.

868
01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:35.179
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: No, actually, I don't know which breakout room to go to.

869
01:53:35.610 --> 01:53:39.370
Sowmya A: Oh, I'll just tell you that Shitran Latar.

870
01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.470
Sowmya A: Oh.

871
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.799
Chitra Mohan: I didn't get any breakout room.

872
01:53:49.590 --> 01:53:50.420
Sowmya A: Sorry.

873
01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.170
Chitra Mohan: I didn't get any breakout.

874
01:53:55.550 --> 01:54:01.180
Sowmya A: You should be able to. If you click on the bottom of your screen, there is this more button.

875
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:06.079
Sowmya A: Yeah, you can just move to the breakout room.

876
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:12.719
Sowmya A: You are in Breakout Room 5.

877
01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:17.809
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: I can't see the option.

878
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.770
Sowmya A: Okay, let me just do it pretty cool.

879
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.620
Sowmya A: Let me move you to directly you will be able to direct. I'll move you directly to the.

880
01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:27.999
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: Yeah, you can move me directly. That's true.

881
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.930
Sowmya A: Do we

882
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:35.450
Sowmya A: assign to breakout from 5? Yes, I've done that, Chithra. Let me just assign you one of them.

883
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:39.420
Sowmya A: See? Okay.

884
01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:42.980
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: This is, Samya is inviting me to.

885
01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:44.739
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: Okay, I'll join Room 5.

886
01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:46.959
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

887
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:52.950
Sowmya A: Chitra, your informed one, unless I need to know about it.

888
01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:11.630
Sowmya A: And

889
01:55:55.450 --> 01:55:56.850
Sowmya A: so your time.

890
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.590
Sowmya A: yeah, yeah. But.

891
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.900
Sowmya A: Remember.

892
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.639
Sowmya A: so we can take another minute, or then we can come back to the main session.

893
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:19.150
Sowmya A: Thank you.

894
02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:00.370
latha sriram: Sir. We just finished the discussion, so we came back, sir.

895
02:01:01.110 --> 02:01:06.529
Sowmya A: No worries. That's fine. That's fine. Yeah, we will. I'll close the rooms in another minute.

896
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:07.290
latha sriram: Okay, sir.

897
02:01:07.290 --> 02:01:09.030
Sowmya A: For 30 seconds. I think.

898
02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.490
latha sriram: Okay, sir. Thank you.

899
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.950
Sowmya A: Thank you.

900
02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.989
Aarthy B: But I was just thinking in this question.

901
02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.960
Aarthy B: shouldn't we be adding a condition that P. And T. Can't be or can't be, 0.

902
02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.129
Aarthy B: Because if you look at correct answer, option as B.

903
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:38.470
Sowmya A: Hmm.

904
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:43.430
Aarthy B: When you say either P is 0, TP. Is less than 0, or T is less than 0.

905
02:01:43.890 --> 02:01:44.220
Sowmya A: Yeah.

906
02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.239
Aarthy B: What if the other one is 0?

907
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:51.070
Sowmya A: No. Can either one of them be 0, because the value has to be less than 0?

908
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.190
Sowmya A: Can any of them give you.

909
02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.140
Aarthy B: No, if P is less than 0, or T is less than 0.

910
02:01:58.570 --> 02:01:58.990
Sowmya A: Yeah.

911
02:01:58.990 --> 02:02:01.160
Aarthy B: In this condition, if you choose this.

912
02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:05.539
Aarthy B: this is the correct option, right according to the current scenario.

913
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:09.929
Aarthy B: But when a child is testing, when P is less than 0

914
02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.980
Aarthy B: and assume that condition is satisfied.

915
02:02:13.530 --> 02:02:17.100
Aarthy B: And what if T is 0, then.

916
02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:18.070
Sowmya A: I'm busy right now.

917
02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.060
Aarthy B: That is not given. No.

918
02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:26.040
Sowmya A: No, no, T can't be 0, because the value will never be less than 0. Then right? The 5 right hand side is less than 0,

919
02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:32.599
Sowmya A: so neither of them can be 0, because then, if any one of them is 0, the answer will be 0. It cannot be less than 0.

920
02:02:32.868 --> 02:02:39.300
Aarthy B: But generically, when we permit, it is not better if it is stated in the beginning. Only the p and T are not 0.

921
02:02:39.710 --> 02:02:40.690
Sowmya A: So these are the.

922
02:02:40.690 --> 02:02:41.510
Aarthy B: Questions.

923
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:49.449
latha sriram: Because you have just given us integers, sir, as a student I will think that 0 is also an integer, as she rightly asked, why should I not consider

924
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:50.180
latha sriram: the good.

925
02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:50.700
Sowmya A: Yes.

926
02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:51.800
latha sriram: Mentioning, no.

927
02:02:51.970 --> 02:02:56.910
Sowmya A: Yeah, because the inequality says less than 0. It does not say less than equal to 0.

928
02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:14.309
Sowmya A: That's why. So the expectation is that students understand they may come up with that scenario, but they will dismiss it by this knowledge, that if I multiply any number with any number, and if one of them is 0. The answer can only be 0. It cannot be less than 0.

929
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:26.240
Aarthy B: No, sometimes, if you see in competency questions nowadays, sometimes even these delimiter cases, boundary cases are also considered. No, so you might get one more option as ee.

930
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:38.759
Aarthy B: For no value of p and T. It might satisfy for non-zero value of p and T. Satisfying this, it can be 0. It also depends on how the options are framed as well. Right.

931
02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:44.379
Sowmya A: That's true, that's true, but in this case it is. I think it's pretty clear. There's no information missing in this.

932
02:03:45.462 --> 02:03:50.779
Aarthy B: But I feel it is. If you add that condition, it will make it more clearer.

933
02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:55.899
Aarthy B: because, as such, if I take P is 0 P. Is less than 0.

934
02:03:56.870 --> 02:04:02.030
Aarthy B: Let me take any value, if for anything, it should satisfy this. No, that is what we are looking at right.

935
02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:03.490
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah.

936
02:04:04.050 --> 02:04:07.769
Aarthy B: If P is less than 0, I take P as minus one, I take T as 0.

937
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:13.100
Aarthy B: It is not satisfying, so B. Can't be my answer. A child might have tested with 0.

938
02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:15.270
Sowmya A: Hmm!

939
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:21.029
Sowmya A: So then that's why it's not one of the choices. No, 0 is not one of the choices.

940
02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:30.380
Aarthy B: Equal to 0 is not one of the choices. That is why I think, even if they think about it.

941
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:31.660
Aarthy B: No, if I say it.

942
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:32.760
Sowmya A: Yeah.

943
02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:38.009
Aarthy B: No see if either p is less than 0 that is satisfied.

944
02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:38.980
Sowmya A: Hmm.

945
02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:45.080
Aarthy B: T equal to t is less than 0, greater than 0 or t equal to 0. All 3 are possible cases right.

946
02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.280
Sowmya A: Hmm.

947
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:53.380
Aarthy B: So when I take t second case, if I take either P is less than 0, or T is less than 0.

948
02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:54.720
Sowmya A: Good.

949
02:04:55.090 --> 02:04:59.130
Aarthy B: I satisfy the 1st part, the, or need not be satisfied. No.

950
02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:03.720
Aarthy B: in either or.

951
02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:12.559
Sowmya A: Yeah, when you say, or either this or this means it is independent of the other.

952
02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:16.610
Sowmya A: So if I say P lesser than 0, then it does not.

953
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.560
Sowmya A: or T. Lesser than 0. That means any one of them is sufficient.

954
02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.550
Sowmya A: Is that what you're saying? Correct.

955
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:32.229
Aarthy B: That is what I'm saying. Let's take this example. If P is less than 0, if I take P as minus one.

956
02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:43.880
Aarthy B: Yeah, that condition is satisfied enough. But T is, the child has taken a 0. You'll get a negative. This one will essentially lead to 0, so it won't satisfy.

957
02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:47.400
Sowmya A: Yeah, which is correct. And B is not the right answer. That's why.

958
02:05:58.530 --> 02:06:00.390
Sowmya A: Okay, shall we all come back?

959
02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:03.370
Sowmya A: This is a very interesting question. Actually.

960
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:07.860
Sowmya A: let's just quickly go through it. I mean, conscious of the time.

961
02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:16.009
Sowmya A: Close all rooms, all quarters, eventually 60 seconds to come back there.

962
02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:19.919
Sowmya A: Let's just hopefully. All of you can come back.

963
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:24.429
Sowmya A: Just take up 2, 2, 3 min to discuss this question.

964
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:30.460
Suchita Kadambi: Yes, sir, we have discussed that

965
02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:41.739
Suchita Kadambi: breakout room one we assume that middle school children will apply the trial and error method only because.

966
02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.059
Sowmya A: You know.

967
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:45.360
Suchita Kadambi: Have the knowledge of inequalities over here at this stage.

968
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.760
Sowmya A: Hmm, hmm.

969
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:56.730
Suchita Kadambi: So, and generally, what they think is minus into minus is plus. So they try to, you know. Apply that, and choose the option.

970
02:06:59.010 --> 02:07:08.846
Sowmya A: yeah. So let's just quickly look at the stats also on this, as you can see that this particular question was offered in 2 successive

971
02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:13.239
Sowmya A: paper terms like summer and winter.

972
02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:21.130
Sowmya A: But the percentage of of incorrect answers, or even the right answers remain almost the same.

973
02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:50.389
Sowmya A: So it seems to be that this particular scenario is unfortunately not being addressed when we are looking at, you know, by the conventional method by which integer concepts are being explained right? This might be. Obviously, this is a above average difficulty question. But then still the very low percentage of right answers into successive terms in which it was given

974
02:07:50.500 --> 02:08:03.139
Sowmya A: seems to indicate that there must be a deep gap somewhere, right which students are not able to surmount. And hence this high percentage of incorrect answers in this case. So.

975
02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:03.810
RANJINI GOPALAKRISHNAN: So.

976
02:08:03.810 --> 02:08:04.140
Sowmya A: Boom.

977
02:08:06.630 --> 02:08:10.040
Suchita Kadambi: Because I feel it is age appropriate answering.

978
02:08:10.410 --> 02:08:16.010
Suchita Kadambi: A middle school child will get it wrong because the question is little bit of a higher level.

979
02:08:16.570 --> 02:08:17.360
Sowmya A: Hmm.

980
02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:28.245
Suchita Kadambi: See. At 6th and 7th they get introduced to basics. Then they learn operations. So you know, then they learn comparing of integers so suddenly, you know.

981
02:08:28.770 --> 02:08:31.680
Suchita Kadambi: it will contradict to their thinking. I feel.

982
02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:33.410
Sowmya A: Hmm.

983
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:58.300
Ranjith P C: Is the problem. So can we see in the primary, sorry middle school early because we don't teach the inequality that quickly. So what happens is if 2 negative numbers. So if they have, they 1st of all go with the negative into negative positive sense. So 1st of all, the sales. First, st confusion will be, why is this minus p into minus T itself is less than 0? Because I've been taught that, you know.

984
02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:23.259
Ranjith P C: 2 negative integers. If you multiply, I get positive, why is it so? But apart from that, the major, Major Chunk will solve the problem by taking the example. Okay, if anybody has to introduce the idea of a 2 negative, 2 numbers are negative. So either of them is negative, basically. So in that case, minus p is less than 0 or minus or minus t is less than 0. If minus p is less than 0,

985
02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:42.470
Ranjith P C: P will be positive. So that sense. You know that minus p. Less than 0 and moving to P. Greater than 0 from there, that slightly challenging for the child to understand. That's where I'm coming. I'm not sure in for which grade we have conduct. You have conducted this asset for.

986
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:48.069
Sowmya A: I think it's for 7, th it's yeah, definitely not 6. It's, I think, 7th or, yeah, yeah, it's probably 7.th Yeah.

987
02:09:48.070 --> 02:09:52.309
Ranjith P C: Okay. Okay, that may be one reason you got mostly wrong. I think.

988
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:55.789
Suchita Kadambi: Or even in 7.th We don't introduce inequalities.

989
02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.430
Sowmya A: Hmm.

990
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:58.130
Savita S M: No in trouble.

991
02:09:58.130 --> 02:09:58.590
Sowmya A: Okay.

992
02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:05.769
Savita S M: Class 7 they are not introduced to multiplication division in Class 6, so they are learning it for the 1st time.

993
02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:06.660
Sowmya A: Sure.

994
02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:12.370
Savita S M: Of the question. The comprehension itself will take some time, be repeated.

995
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:25.790
Savita S M: reinforce it, say, by grade 8. They might be able to practice their comprehension, I think, becomes an issue, and it is too long. They will just give up. Some of them will just give up reading the question after the 1st line.

996
02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:27.160
Sowmya A: Alright!

997
02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:39.669
Suchita Kadambi: But in the middle school level it will contribute, contradict to what they have learned as they have learned minus into minus is positive. Then why is it here less than 0? That is the contradiction they get in their mind.

998
02:10:41.210 --> 02:10:52.070
krithika S: And they will not apply that P. And Q are 2 integers immediately. Their mind will not go, for that P can be a negative integer also, or T can be a negative integer

999
02:10:52.520 --> 02:11:00.689
krithika S: immediately, the child not thinking that way. It will take 8th or 9.th When they come to that age they can able to associate with this.

1000
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:02.500
Sowmya A: Hmm.

1001
02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:14.860
Sowmya A: yeah, I think it would have been the same question for 7th and 8 together. So even 8 standard students would be figuring in this distribution that that is there.

1002
02:11:15.566 --> 02:11:26.819
Sowmya A: Because some sometimes for difficulty levels, some questions might be shared across 7th and 8 standards. So even that standards are would have written the same question.

1003
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:30.540
latha sriram: The sorry to interfere. Are you sharing your screen? That.

1004
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:31.800
Sowmya A: Yeah. Can you not see?

1005
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:34.700
latha sriram: I don't know. I'm not able to see.

1006
02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:40.829
Sowmya A: No, no, I think what happens is, maybe every time I go into breakout room I think my screen sharing goes away.

1007
02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:44.709
Suchita Kadambi: Sir, are we having any assignment today.

1008
02:11:46.360 --> 02:12:09.460
Sowmya A: Yeah, the assignment I will post on the Google drive, and then we send you the link, so that I will send you the link to the document. So it will be like a few questions on similar to this on integers which you can basically what you would what we would like you to do is explain some approaches that you would feel might help solve the kind of gaps.

1009
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:12.979
Ranjith P C: And so again, sorry can you make in big screen, full screen.

1010
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:14.520
Sowmya A: Okay, so it's.

1011
02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.140
Ranjith P C: Yeah, thank, you.

1012
02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.197
Sowmya A: So the assignments

1013
02:12:19.210 --> 02:12:42.919
Sowmya A: that we will be giving basically will be based on questions like these. And the objective is to see how many? What are the different approaches that we can employ to answer these questions, or teach students to answer such questions? And what might be the stumbling blocks for students. Where might a student youth, in your opinion, where might a student go wrong in answering a question like this?

1014
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:55.849
Sowmya A: So and then your responses have to be in that word, Doc, that I had shared earlier, and I will be sending across all the details of the links and what you need to do in that document?

1015
02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:58.190
Sowmya A: Does does that answer your question?

1016
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:09.389
Savita S M: I just have another observation regarding integer, the conceptions, conceptions which get carried over to higher classes, especially when it comes to correlation.

1017
02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:10.230
Savita S M: Physics.

1018
02:13:10.230 --> 02:13:11.320
Suchita Kadambi: Absolutely. Yeah.

1019
02:13:11.590 --> 02:13:16.560
Savita S M: For example, when we talk about velocity and speed, I think someone mentioned.

1020
02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:30.109
Savita S M: yes, we never talk about negative distances, but we do talk about negative velocities. So a simple question, which is faster, minus 15 meters per second, or minus or plus 5 meters per second.

1021
02:13:30.430 --> 02:13:31.150
Sowmya A: Okay.

1022
02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:41.190
Savita S M: Most of them say plus 5, because minus 15 is a negative number, and a negative number minus 15 is less than 5.

1023
02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:59.379
Savita S M: Majority of the students have this because it is so by the time they come to speed velocity. This concept is so ingrained that negative numbers are lesser than positive that they cannot imagine a scenario where minus 15 can be greater than plus 5.

1024
02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.890
Savita S M: So this is one misconception which I come across even later when they do optics.

1025
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:09.989
Savita S M: time conventions. The same issue happens when we are dealing with magnification.

1026
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:12.640
Sowmya A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

1027
02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:20.220
Savita S M: Because minus 3 is less than whatever. So how do we tackle conception?

1028
02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:24.839
Savita S M: This is ingrained. Right? 6, 7, 8, all reinforced integer concept.

1029
02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:49.360
Sowmya A: Yes, yes, and that is why I think really good point, really amazing point made by you. And that is why I was. I keep stressing that we have to pick our examples very, very carefully. It might work in the short term. But will it work in the long term? And because the same students who who might be really happy that they are able to solve most of the questions in the paper because of the way you might have taught them

1030
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:56.829
Sowmya A: might again develop a different thinking at when he go, when he or she goes into higher standards, saying, Why is this? Why did

1031
02:14:56.830 --> 02:15:06.530
Sowmya A: this this not working for me? It works so nicely when I was in lower standards. Why is there a new paradigm right now? So it's very important to pick your examples.

1032
02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:15.689
Sowmya A: such that you have an insight into. What will this lead to later for them? What will this be? A segue into for concept wise

1033
02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:40.019
Sowmya A: when they when they are going into higher standards. So I think collectively, we have a very much higher responsibility than maybe high school teachers right to to generate, to put in those seeds that when you, you know, nurture them, they will grow in the right direction. So it's very important what context and what examples we take are the examples, such that they're limiting

1034
02:15:40.360 --> 02:16:04.600
Sowmya A: the expansion of their thinking, then it's not enough. Right? So examples should be such that they might not explain everything, but they still open the possibility for it. Saying this, you may learn later, but whatever I'm saying now will not be contradicted at any point of time. What I'm saying is true, but you may learn more about it as you go on.

1035
02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:28.239
Sowmya A: So that example picking of examples. And that's why I mentioned that, should we look at an elevator example? Should we look at a car example? Should we look at an accounting example if we give them context. When we are teaching these things, maybe they'll understand it better, saying, this works better in an accounting scenario, but it can be used, and that's where perhaps we have to strive a little bit more to show

1036
02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:41.690
Sowmya A: an accounting example can be picked, as is into a vectors example or an optics example, as you mentioned, where magnitude becomes more important than the sign so, and that's, for example, with direction.

1037
02:16:41.799 --> 02:17:10.509
Sowmya A: negative direction is just another another movement, whereas if you look at deficit, it's the lack of something. So conceptually. There are 2 different things. Lack of something is not the same as moving in the opposite direction in the same way as you would in the positive direction. So there are 2 very different concepts that need to be probably understood, and context should be built around these examples, at least for integers. I believe.

1038
02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:14.939
Savita S M: Yes, the direct, the concept of directed numbers.

1039
02:17:15.209 --> 02:17:20.590
Savita S M: So we have to use that all the time that the direction also matters sometimes.

1040
02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:29.249
Sowmya A: Yeah. And I, I think, fortunately and unfortunately, as we go into higher standards, most of the examples are to do with direction.

1041
02:17:29.250 --> 02:17:58.849
Sowmya A: So integers take a very different form. It's always vectors. Everything is vectors. So students lose sight unless they're taking up a subject like economics or commerce or finance, they lose. Subsequently they lose touch with integers. As an accounting concept, they start moving into vector interpretation of integers, so they may lose some ground there as well. So we just need to ensure that the balance is maintained between each of these interpretations.

1042
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:05.428
Suchita Kadambi: So how can, sir? Can I log in through my phone?

1043
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.950
Suchita Kadambi: Hello!

1044
02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:08.860
Sowmya A: Yeah, yeah, you sure you can.

1045
02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:14.819
Suchita Kadambi: Yeah, because my son has an online class, he needs the laptop. So can I just log out and log in through the phone.

1046
02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:22.609
Sowmya A: No worries, no worries. You can do that, but we are just almost coming to a close. I mean, if there are any things that you would like to. Anyone would like to bring up

1047
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:24.049
Sowmya A: questions at.

1048
02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:24.999
Suchita Kadambi: Yes.

1049
02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:52.730
Ranjith P C: So can one request. I don't know whether it's possible. This questions which you're posting here? All these questions are very good questions. Okay? Because, as such questions of the quality is, if you can mention which grade it is was, you know, administrate, which one I mean, if you can. If you can mention that band also grade 8 or grade 9 or grade 6 to 8. That will give us a

1050
02:18:52.730 --> 02:19:14.460
Ranjith P C: very good understanding that you know this kind of questions, though the children are learning, you know, indigenous at the peripheral level in grade 6. Okay, the initial level. But this kind of questions have been asked in the competitive exam or assessment exam, like a set, so that also gives a sense to the teachers. Probably if you can mention the grade

1051
02:19:14.459 --> 02:19:22.280
Ranjith P C: for which it is administrated, then it will help us a thought to you know, internalize, and you know, moving forward with that.

1052
02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:29.930
Sowmya A: Yeah, I'll take that down, I think, for this set. We did not have it. I think I'll make sure that next time we do have.

1053
02:19:29.930 --> 02:19:32.940
Ranjith P C: Yeah, if you could do it, it will be great help for us. Thank you.

1054
02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:33.549
Sowmya A: Good.

1055
02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:34.600
Sowmya A: Yeah.

1056
02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:37.539
Sowmya A: Anything else from anyone.

1057
02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:42.199
Sowmya A: I'm sorry we had passed the hour. Yeah.

1058
02:19:42.209 --> 02:19:45.859
Aarthy B: I already spoke about T. 0 case.

1059
02:19:46.419 --> 02:19:49.319
Aarthy B: the B being the correct answer, I think it has.

1060
02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:49.670
Sowmya A: Yeah.

1061
02:19:49.670 --> 02:20:03.250
Aarthy B: The T not equal to 0 or other one not equal to 0 somewhere in that question has to be, because, as such, B does not satisfy because we order. We have to cater to all the Tq children as well. Right? What we give is correct

1062
02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:09.749
Aarthy B: should be objectively correct. They will come up with a case and counter. Say, for this it does not satisfy.

1063
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:17.850
Sowmya A: Yeah. And also the meaning of, or is actually ambiguous in math. The meaning of, or is different from, the English or

1064
02:20:18.392 --> 02:20:35.150
Sowmya A: the English is an exhaust. Actually, so, there is some gap there also, I think, understanding what or means from logical operation versus how it is used in English. There is a gap in that also, because in case of math, the logical, or includes the and condition.

1065
02:20:35.310 --> 02:20:43.860
Sowmya A: so B will be actually a subset of a as well, whereas in English, or means either this or that, it can't be both.

1066
02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:58.870
Aarthy B: Yeah, because this is either or right, and we are targeting 6 to 8. So it is more with the English or not. The gates, idea and all will not even build by then. So that I think if you can give a feedback for this question, it might be useful.

1067
02:20:59.310 --> 02:21:00.269
Sowmya A: Yeah, we'll do that.

1068

Sowmya A: Okay, can you talk to anyone?

1069
02:21:08.730 --> 02:21:27.730
Sowmya A: Okay? So yeah, by, I think within the next few days, we will be meeting alternately. Now we will have the teacher hour session on Wednesday, where I will be discussing the last set of assignments that you had done. In terms of what what the findings are. And then

1070
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:48.599
Sowmya A: We will meet again after 2 weeks for the next session. Within that time I will be posting these assignments, which will be a set of questions, feel free to take some of these questions to your class, and finding your observations. But the objective is that you should be able to put forth your own views

1071
02:21:48.600 --> 02:22:05.770
Sowmya A: on how? What is the best way of solving these questions, and what might be the difficulties or challenges students might face. So we will be going through these assignments from time to time to see how what progress you are making, and if you have doubts you can always reach out to us.

1072
02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:11.890
