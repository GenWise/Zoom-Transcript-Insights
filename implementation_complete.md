## Ready for GitHub

The codebase is now ready to be pushed to GitHub. Use the `setup_github.sh` script to initialize the repository and push it to GitHub:

```bash
./setup_github.sh https://github.com/username/zoom-transcript-insights.git
```

## Next Feature: Webhook Integration

The next major feature to implement is webhook integration for automatic processing of new recordings. This will involve:

1. Setting up webhook endpoints to receive notifications from Zoom
2. Implementing verification and security for webhook endpoints
3. Creating automatic processing of new recordings as they become available
4. Adding email notifications to send insight links to hosts when processing completes

This feature will be implemented in a separate development phase.
