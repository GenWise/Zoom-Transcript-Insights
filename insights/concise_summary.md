The session explored AI applications in education, covering transcript analysis, timetable generation, data interpretation, and content creation, with emphasis on developing effective prompts for educational materials. Participants engaged in hands-on experimentation with various AI tools including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude through breakout rooms and guided demonstrations of advanced capabilities like simulations and audio generation. Teachers showed high engagement, actively sharing practical applications from their teaching experience and demonstrating improved ability to craft effective AI prompts for their specific subject areas. Notable outcomes included successful implementations of AI for timetable generation, quiz creation, and visualization tools, with recognition of AI's potential to enhance lesson delivery through interactive content. The session identified follow-up areas including ethical considerations, school-wide implementation frameworks, and additional training on creating visual content with AI tools.
