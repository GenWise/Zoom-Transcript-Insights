Dr. Mohan's masterclass explored the neuroscience of memory, distinguishing between explicit/declarative and implicit/procedural memory types while highlighting the hippocampus's essential role in memory formation. The session covered memory encoding, storage, and retrieval processes, demonstrating how memories can be distorted through recall and explaining the neural basis of memory through strengthened synaptic connections. Teaching approaches included interactive polls, memory tests, case studies (notably patient H.M.), brain imaging examples, and scientific demonstrations of memory fallibility. Students showed high engagement through questions about brain function and neural systems, learning how the brain efficiently stores memories using minimal energy and understanding memory's reconstructive nature. Follow-up opportunities include Dr. Mohan's upcoming workshop on vision and the brain, with students expressing interest in further neuroscience resources and memory enhancement techniques.
