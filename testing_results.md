# Testing Results and Next Steps

## Testing Results

We attempted to test the `extract_historical_recordings.py` script and encountered the following issue:

```
Invalid access token, does not contain scopes:[cloud_recording:read:list_account_recordings:master].
```

This error indicates that the Zoom API credentials used don't have the required scope to list account recordings.

We modified the script to handle this case by falling back to the user-level endpoint for recordings, which requires a different scope that was already available. The script now:

1. First attempts to use the account-level endpoint
2. If that fails, it falls back to listing users and getting recordings for each user
3. Successfully processes any recordings found

We tested the script with different date ranges, and it executed successfully, but no recordings were found. This could be because:
- There are no recordings in the Zoom account for the specified date ranges
- The recordings might be stored in a different account
- The recordings might have been deleted or expired

## Required Zoom API Configuration

To properly use the scripts, the Zoom API app needs to be configured with the following scopes:

1. `recording:read:admin` - Required to list recordings
2. `recording:write:admin` - Required to manage recordings
3. `cloud_recording:read:list_account_recordings:master` - Required for account-level access (optional, as the script now falls back to user-level access)
4. `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings:admin` - Required for user-level access

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Known Recording Dates**:
   - If you know specific dates when recordings were made, try using those dates in the script
   - For example: `python scripts/extract_historical_recordings.py --start-date 2024-06-01 --end-date 2024-06-30 --temp-dir ./temp`

2. **Upload a Sample Recording**:
   - If you have a sample VTT file, you can test the processing script directly
   - Create a folder structure in Google Drive manually
   - Upload the VTT file to that folder
   - Run the processing script: `python scripts/process_drive_recordings.py --temp-dir ./temp`

3. **Set Up Webhook Integration** (for production use):
   - Deploy the application to a server with a public URL
   - Configure the webhook in Zoom App settings
   - Point it to your `/webhook/recording-completed` endpoint

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented:

1. ✅ Script to extract historical recordings from Zoom
   - Added fallback to user-level endpoint if account-level access is not available
   - Successfully tested the script's execution (though no recordings were found)

2. ✅ Script to process recordings stored in Google Drive
   - Ready to test with actual recordings

3. ✅ Webhook integration for automatic processing of new recordings
   - Ready to deploy and test with actual webhook events
